            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>In what ſenſe Reaſon is taken and diſcourſed of here. A double account of it; the firſt, more Notional; the ſecond, more Real. Of the Agreements of Reaſon, Senſe, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. (1.) That all three are Cogitative and Conceptive Powers. Cogitation what. <hi>Monſieur des Cartes,</hi> and <hi>Honoratus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> their Opinion, that Senſation is not Cogitation, conſidered, (2.) That Senſe, Imagination, and Reaſon are Mental and Spiritual, and not meerly Mechanick and Material Powers. The Differences of thoſe Powers; that all Senſation is Imagination, and what is commonly called Imagination, is but Internal Senſation. Intellection or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, is Knowing without Imagination. Inſtances, ſetting out theſe ſeveral Notions. The power of Knowing without Imagining, why called Reaſon.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65808:5"/>REASON taken for Human <hi>Mind,</hi> or Underſtanding (which is the ſenſe I take it in now) is defined by moſt, the faculty whereby a Man is ſaid to be Reaſonable, or Underſtanding; in like manner as <hi>Sight</hi> is defined, the faculty whereby a Living Creature is Denominated Seeing, or Viſive, or Reaſon is that faculty whereby a Man does Exerciſe the acts of Reaſon, or doth Underſtand; as Sight, the faculty whereby a Man or any other Animal doth ſee, or diſcern Objects.</p>
                  <p>Nor are they altogether without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who do ſo define and explicate it; for <hi>Acts</hi> of Perception properly ſo called, are not Known, or Knowable, but in and by themſelves; we Know not, nor are capable of Knowing, what the Act of See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, but by ſeeing; nor what that of Hearing is, but by Hearing; or what the Act of Underſtanding is, but by Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And again, <hi>Perceptive faculties</hi> are not Known, or Knowable, but by their Acts: We Know not what the faculty or power of Seeing is but <hi>relatively,</hi> with relation to the Act of Seeing: Nor what the faculty or Power of Hearing is, but by the Act of Hearing; nor what the faculty or power of Underſtanding or Reaſoning is, but by <hi>Acts</hi> of Underſtanding or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning:<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65808:5"/>In a word, no Faculties, no Powers are Known, or Knowable, but by their reſpective Acts or Exerciſes, and therefore they cannot be defined or ſet out but by them. All this is certain.</p>
                  <p>However, ſince this is but a notional fruitleſs way of Explicating Reaſon, and too ſhort, too narrow to ſatisfie a Curious and Inquiſitive Mind; therefore to ſettle an <hi>Idea</hi> of it, that may be more to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, more real, and more edifying; I will ſhow, in the firſt place, the <hi>Agreements</hi> it hath with other Conceptive Cogitative faculties, what it holds in common with them; and afterwards, ſet out the
<hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> that do diſcriminate and divide theſe ſeveral faculties, each from other, and this particularly from the Reſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conceptive Cogitative</hi> Faculties that are in Man, (for ſo I call the Faculties by which he makes acquaintance with exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Objects) are his external <hi>Senſe, Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> (as it is called) and
<hi>Reaſon</hi> or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: <hi>Three</hi> Faculties which do all
<hi>Agree</hi> and Concur in this, that they are <hi>Conceptive</hi> and
<hi>Cogitative,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Mental</hi> and
<hi>Spiritual,</hi> and not meerly <hi>Mechanick</hi> and <hi>Material</hi> Powers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; All three are <hi>Conceptive, Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Powers; Senſation and Imagination, as well as Reaſoning or Intellection, are<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65808:6"/>
                     <hi>Cogitations.</hi> Cogitation is conſcious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; <hi>Conſcious Affection,</hi> is Affection with Conſciouſneſs of that Affection; and by another name is called
<hi>Knowledge.</hi> Knowledge, as it has a double relation, ſo it may be conſidered two ways, to wit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reference to the <hi>Object,</hi> which is Known, and ſo, properly, it is <hi>Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion</hi> or Conſcious Perception; or, as it reſpects the <hi>Image</hi> and
<hi>Idea,</hi> by means of which we do perceive or know that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſo it may be called <hi>Conception.</hi> Conception properly ſpeaking, is of the Image, or Idea; Apprehenſion, Knowledge, or conſcious Perception is of the Object, by means of that Idea, or Image: It is as proper to ſay, that the Senſe and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation do conceive, as that the Reaſon or Underſtanding doth; the former does as much conceive Images and Sentiments, as the latter does Ideas and Notions.</p>
                  <p>Conception and Cogitation, really are but one Act, and conſequently, all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive are Cogitative Powers, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative Powers Conceptive. Only, to clear the Notion of <hi>Conſciouſneſs,</hi> by which
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation</hi> or Knowledge is diſtinguiſhed, tho' never divided, from <hi>Conception,</hi> we muſt further conſider the <hi>Way</hi> and Manner how Conſciouſneſs Ariſes. And it ſeems to me to
<hi>ariſe,</hi> ordinarily, from the diſtinction<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65808:6"/>and difference that is in Conceptions; for, ſhould any perſon have his Eye perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tied to one Object, without ever cloſing of, or turning it to another, he would no more be ſenſible that he <hi>ſaw</hi> that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or know any more what it was to <hi>ſee,</hi> than if he had been blind from his Birth. For ſince <hi>Conſciouſneſs of Seeing</hi> is nothing but a perceiving by the Eye, that one is Affected, or otherwiſe Affected than he was, with the appearance of Light, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. If a perſon had never ſeen but one thing, and never but ſeen it, he could have no perceivance (that) he is ſo Affected, that is, he could not be ſenſible or conſcious (that) he did ſee. Thus, tho' in our Members the parts that do compoſe them are contiguous one to another, and do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways touch, yet we do not feel them touch, that is, they touch, but we are not ſenſible they do, becauſe no difference being in the Affection, there is no Senſe, no Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it: But Diſlocation is ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; as alſo it is when any part is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unuſually. I conclude, that as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Conception ariſes from different Affections of the Faculties by Objects, ſo Conſciouſneſs, or Senſe of Conception, ariſes from the difference of Conceptions. Did we know but one thing, or had but one Act of Conception, we ſhould not know<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65808:7"/>that we did know that one, that is, that Conception would not properly be Cogitation, but would be, as toubhing without feeling. However, ſince there is ſo great a diverſity of Objects in the World, all-around us, and conſequently, ſo many various Impreſſions made upon the Mind, by thoſe Objects, ſo that its Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power cannot but be diverſly Affected, and moved, and the Mind alſo have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivance of that diverſity; hence it comes to paſs, that Conception is always Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. In ſhort, Conception is Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind, and Cogitation is Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Conſciouſneſs of it. Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conception is a ſenſe of the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made in the Mind by that Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (of which it is conſcious;) <hi>ſi</hi> nihil (ſays <hi>Cotta apud Cicer. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Nat. Deor.</hi>) <hi>inter Deum &amp; Deum</hi> differt,
<hi>nulla eſt apud Deos</hi> cognitio nulla <hi>perceptio,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know very well that Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> the ingenious <hi>Honorato Fabri,</hi> and many others do differ from me, for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as they do) that Senſation is Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and conſequently, excluding both Conception and Conſciouſneſs from the Idea of it, they muſt alſo deny, that Senſe is a Cogitative or Conceptive Power. But then, it is hard to ſay, what that Idea is, that they have of Senſation. Beſides, 'tis<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65808:7"/>moſt certain that in Men, Senſation is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perception, for whatever Impreſſion is made upon our Eye by any Object, we do not for all that, diſcern, or ſee the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if we do not atend unto, as well as receive, the Impreſſion; that is, we do not diſcern or ſee, but when we Know we do. Then only we have a Senſation of Objects, when we are Conſcious that they do Impreſs us; that is, when our Organs being Impreſſed, there ariſe and ſpring up in us, by means of thoſe Impreſſions, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Images or Conceptions, that (many of them) by a Natural deluſion do ſeem as really to Exiſt without us, in the Objects themſelves, as if they were indeed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny real Affections of them, or Inherent Accidents in them. And thoſe Images be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but Modifications of Mind, ariſe not in us upon any Impreſſions but when the Mind Attends to them, for elſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Affect it.</p>
                  <p>But happily it will be told me, that this Conſciouſneſs of Impreſſions, which is in men, when they do ſee, or hear, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perceive Objects, by the Affections of their External Organs, Ariſes in them only from the <hi>Concomitance</hi> of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; becauſe in men, whatevet Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Senſe, is alſo perceived by the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; but that there neither is, nor<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65808:8"/>can be, any ſuch thing in other Animals, which are as void of Conſciouſneſs of any Impreſſion made upon their Organs, as they are of that Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that makes it in Men. But as this may be ſaid, ſo it may be as eaſily Replyed to; for 'tis as impoſſible, that Men ſhould have any clear, or indeed any <hi>Idea,</hi> at all of Senſation, in other
<hi>Species</hi> of Animals, but by that, which they have of their own;
<hi>as</hi> it is certain, that Senſation in Men cannot be underſtood to be without Conception, nor Conception without At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Mind. <hi>Attention of Mind,</hi> is the Application of it unto Objects, and therefore in Men, is called <hi>Minding:</hi> Without Attention no Conception, and without Conception no Conſciouſneſs; Conſciouſneſs being (as I have ſaid) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Senſe of Alteration made in the Mind, by ſome new Affection of it, that is, by a new Thought or Conception. Beſides, there are many other things that do make for this Opinion, that all Animal Senſation is Cogitation; particularly, that great <hi>Sagacity</hi> that is in ſome Animals, which cannot be accounted for with any clearneſs, but by allowing to them a great degree of Knowledge and Conſciouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>And hence it follows, that Senſe and Imagination, as well as the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65808:8"/>and Reaſon, are Mental and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, not meerly Mechanick and Material Powers By Mechanick and meerly Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Powers I underſtand ſuch as do reſult from Matter only, and the Modes of Matter; from Local Motion and Reſt, and from Size, Figure and Texture. By
<hi>Mental Spiritual</hi> Powers, I underſtand ſuch as cannot be conceived to ariſe from Matter only, and the Modes of Matter, without the Influence of Mind; and in the number of theſe I reckon Senſe, and Imagination, as well as the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Reaſon. It is true, the term [<hi>Mind</hi>] is Appropriated, by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, to the Underſtanding or Reaſon, this being a faculty that hath the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Mind in a higher degree than the others have: But yet, there is Mind, and as much of Mind in all the Conceptive Cogitative Acts of Senſe or Imagination, as there is of Conception and Cogitation in them. Thus I have ſhewed how Senſe, Imagination, and Reaſon do <hi>agree,</hi> now I am to ſhew how they <hi>differ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Senſe,</hi> (by which I mean the power of Seeing, of Hearing, of Taſting, of Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and of Feeling,) is that by which we make acquaintance with External Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and have Knowledge of them by means of Images and Apparitions, or<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65808:9"/>(which is a better expreſſion, as being more General and Comprehenſive,) by <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents</hi> excited in the External Organs, through Impreſſions made upon them from Objects.
<hi>Imagination</hi> is internal Senſe, or an (After) Repreſentation of the Images or Sentiments (that have been) excited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Senſe: This is the Baſis and Foundation of it; Compoſition, Diviſion, and Enlargement of Images, is but Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory, but Superſtructure, and an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Senſe. <hi>Reaſon</hi> or Underſtanding, is a faculty by which we know External Objects, as well as our own Acts, without framing Images of them;; only by <hi>Ideas</hi> or Notions. In ſhort, <hi>Senſation,</hi> properly, is Imagination, for every Senſe Imagines; and that, which commonly is called
<hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> is but Remembrance, or Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Senſation. Imagination, is <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> of Senſation made from within, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, is Imagination occaſioned by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Impreſſions from without us. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> or Underſtanding, is refined, Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated Senſation, that is, a conſcious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of things by <hi>Notions</hi> or Ideas, and not by Images, or ſenſible Repreſentations. And thus,
<hi>all</hi> the cogitative powers that are in Man, may be reduced to
<hi>Two,</hi> to <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> the former compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Imagination, which is but<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65808:9"/>the power of Remembring Senſations, and of Amplifying them; and the Letter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Intellectual Remembrance, which is only a recollection of Ideas or Notions.</p>
                  <p>But to make a Reflection of more light, it may be minded, that when we look on a <hi>Book,</hi> (to Inſtance in a thing that is next to hand,) and read any <hi>Sentence</hi> in it, as this, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> we have at that time in our Eyes the <hi>Figures</hi> of the <hi>Letters</hi> that compoſe the Words, and ſo do know by <hi>them,</hi> what the words are; and this is <hi>Senſe.</hi> But if putting aſide the Book we will endeavour to <hi>Recollect</hi> thoſe words, we muſt do it one of
<hi>two</hi> ways; <hi>either</hi> by Retrieving in our thoughts the very Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Imagies of the Letters and Words before preſented to our Eyes; or (which we oftneſt do) by recalling the Words and Sentence, and ſaying to our ſelves, or unto others, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> without thinking in the leaſt, of any Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the Letters that do make the Words, or of the Images of the Words that compoſe the Sentence. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we do
<hi>Imagine</hi> the Sentence, as raiſing again the Images of the Words that make it, and this is <hi>Senſible</hi> Remembrance; but in the latter, though, when we Recollect the Sentence, we muſt withal (ſome way
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65808:10"/>or other) mind again the words that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, yet we do it <hi>without</hi> Imagining them, and this is <hi>Intellectual</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, or the act of the Reaſon. Add, that at the ſame time that we do ſee the Schemes and Figures of the Letters, and have the portraictures and draughts of the words preſented to our Eyes, which is <hi>Senſe,</hi> we have, or may have, in our minds the ſenſe and meaning of thoſe words, of which ſenſe or meaning however, we have neither Picture or Figure; and this is <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi> In the former we have <hi>Images,</hi> in the latter only <hi>Ideas;</hi> we <hi>See</hi> the words, but underſtand the meaning This power of the Mind, (of perceiving without Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining,) is called
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> becauſe in thoſe Acts in which it does converſe with things by means of words (and thoſe are moſt of the Acts exerted by it) the ſenſe and meaning of the words is (as it were) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and Reaſoned from them. What I have ſaid, ſuffices to make the Notion or Idea of Reaſon or Underſtanding conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by men who uſe Attention, and do
<hi>think,</hi> but nothing will be enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate and ſet it out to ſuch as cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that trouble, but will ſwallow all things without chewing-</p>

Of Prince <hi>Maurices</hi> Parrot. The Acts of Reaſon as taken for the Underſtanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to two, to wit, Apprehenſion and Judgment.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Know very well, that moſt Men, and even moſt Philoſophers do take Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but for <hi>Contrivance,</hi> or for
<hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> which is a ſort of Contrivance; and that Contrivance (a dexterity in which they call <hi>Sagacity,</hi>) is a thinking upon means to compaſs and attain ends; as firſt upon the neareſt means, then upon the means to that, and ſo on till all the neceſſary means are thought upon. But thoſe who<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65808:11"/>think ſo, (to wit, that Reaſon is nothing but Contrivance,) can never evidence that Reaſon is the Character or ſole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Man, (which yet it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly belived, and ſaid to be;) ſince there is Imaginative, as well as Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Contrivance, and Imaginative Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance muſt be owned to belong to Inferior Animals, as well as to Men. My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that other Animals beſides Men, and below them too, have a faculty or power by which, after a ſort, they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the next means (though not under the Notion of a Means) to what they would have, and then the means to that, and ſo by a train of Phantaſms, go on till they have found enough for compaſſing the thing which they deſire and proſecute. I have ſeen an <hi>Hen</hi> whoſe Chicken ran from her through a little hole that was in a Gate, through which ſhe could not follow them, into a Court Inviorned with a very high Wall, that being in a paſſion to come to them, firſt ſhe looks to ſee if ſhe could fly to the top of the Wall, which was the neareſt way and means, but upon Trial finding that unfeaſible, and ſpying at ſome diſtance a Pent-Houſe, from which ſhe was able to gain it, away ſhe flies to That; though it was to go farther than before from her Chickens, and conſequently, no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65808:11"/>ways for her purpoſe, but as it was a means to reach the top of the Wall, which was the neareſt means to get to them: Thus did this
<hi>Hen</hi> contrive for her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
                  <p>The Inſtance I have given is a ſmall one, and in a Creature not remarkable as many others are for Acts of <hi>Sagacity;</hi> it is not an Inſtance in the Elephant, in the Caſtor, the Fox, the Dog, or ſuch other ſubtle Animals; and yet an Inſtance ſerving well enough for my deſign, which is to ſhew, that Reaſon which is proper and Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical to Man, is not meer Contrivance or Diſcouſe. For this it plainly ſheweth, ſince it manifeſts, that Inferiour ſenſitive Creatures are Contriving and Diſcurſive, and capable of making network of their Sentiments and Fantoms; and withal (manifeſts) that Apprehenſion, Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Illation are in ſome ſort, as well the Acts of the Imagination, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all ſenſitives, as of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reaſon, which is peculiar to men. More, and Nobler Examples may be had in
<hi>Rorarius,</hi> and in others of the Moderns; and in <hi>Cicero l.</hi> 2.
<hi>De Natura Deorum,</hi> for the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>The way how Phantaſms are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Imagination, is prettily, though perhaps not adequately, Illuſtrated<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65808:12"/>by M.
<hi>Hobbs,</hi> in a Similitude taken from Water;
<q rend="inline">'Water (ſays he) when moved at once by divers movements, receiveth one motion compounded of them all; ſo it is in the Brain or Spirits ſtirred by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers objects; there is compoſed an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of divers conceptions; that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſingle to the Senſe. As Senſe at one time ſheweth the Figure of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, at another of Gold, and the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination afterwards compoſes them in a Golden Mountain.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But without determining that Images are compounded in the Imagination, juſt the ſame way as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this is certain, a compoſition of them there is, and contrivance too in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and this as well in Animals that are called Irrational, as in Men, who may, in ſome meaſure, gueſs at the latitude and extend thereof in other Animals, by what they find in themſelves, in common
<hi>Dreams.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatever Contrivence (that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles Reaſoning) ſuch Animals as are called Irrational may have, certain it is, that Reaſon taken for the Underſtanding, as the Underſtanding is a power of percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without Imagining, cannot be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced to be in them; they may Imagine, and by force of Imagination, after a ſort<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65808:12"/>Contrive, but it cannot be ſhewed that they Underſtand, or that they do Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the ſame way that men do, who do it by vertue of their Underſtanding. The Contrivance (and conſequently the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) of Irrational Animals, is a pure Effect of Senſe and Imagination, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed only by the <hi>Sequel</hi> of Images, which Sequels is not properly Illation made by way of Judgment, but as (in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Plaſtick) the Images follow one another by means of their
<hi>Congruity;</hi> or of ſome other Antecedent connexion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Memory, which is the Exchequer or common Treaſury of all Senſations, and the diſpoſition and order of Images in it, ſerves to good purpoſe. Such
<hi>Animals,</hi> as they have not that uſe of <hi>words</hi> that Men have (of which hereafter,) ſo they have not that Power of Underſtanding which is termed <hi>Judicative;</hi> a power that ſo Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and Weighs and Ballances Things, and their proportions one to another, by Comparing and Conferring them, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it pronounces upon them; <hi>This</hi> is
<hi>That,</hi> or, <hi>This</hi> is not <hi>That,</hi> and <hi>This</hi> is
<hi>Such,</hi> or, <hi>This</hi> is not <hi>Such;</hi> Which
<hi>Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> ſo pronounced, are called <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> or Enunciations, and are, really, <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Whence it follows, that the ſo much talkt of <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> of Hounds, (for<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65808:13"/>ſo <hi>Reiſch</hi> in his <hi>Margarita Philoſophica</hi> calls it, when he ſays, <hi>In bivio, feram alterâ declinaſſe parte</hi> Sillogizant <hi>canes,</hi>) is meer fallacy; the <hi>Hare</hi> is gone either this way or that way, he ſmells out the minor with his noſe, he is not gone this way, and therefore concluding he is gone the other, doth with open mouth run that way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his putting Noſe to ground. All this is but Senſation, and following of the <hi>Scent,</hi> without any thing of Enunciation or Judgment; there is nothing of <hi>Propoſitions, Major, Minor,</hi> or <hi>Concluſion,</hi> in the caſe: The Hound perhaps does put his Noſe at firſt where the Scent is not, and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, turns another way, where it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be, ſo that upon turning being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtruck with the Scent, he follows it, with an out-cry; without putting of his Noſe to the ground, to ſeek for what he has found already.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, the ſtory of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his Parrot is ſtupendious, and if no Illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in it, as none Appears; or that it was not an Effect of Witchcraft, which I moſt ſuſpect, (the Country of
<hi>Braſill</hi> in which it was Acted, (as all the <hi>Indies</hi>) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many Diabolical Agents, that work by Magick;) I ſhould think it a very
<hi>Croſs</hi> Inſtance to my former Diſcourſe. But conſidering it, as I do, only as an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65808:13"/>of Diabolical power, I put it in the number of the Extraordinary Events, with the Tricks of the <hi>Divining Ape</hi> which Mr. <hi>Terry</hi> writes of, in his Relation of a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into the Eaſt-Indies; and then it may not be drawn into Argument. However, that thinking men may have an Occaſion to employ their Thoughts, and to make an Impartial Judgment, I will tell the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as I find it in Sir <hi>William Temples</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs p. 57. Ed. 2. in his own Words, together with the Reflexion he makes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">"With the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (ſays he) returned moſt of the General Officers to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and among the reſt Old Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> who, as the Prince told me, had with the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry that could be, ſought all occaſions of dying fairly at the Battle of <hi>Seneffe</hi> without ſucceeding, which had given him great regrets; and I did not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it, conſidering his age of about Seventy Six, and his long habits both of Gout and Stone. When he came to viſit me upon his return and before he went to his Government of <hi>Cleve,</hi> it came in my head to ask him an idle queſtion, becauſe I thought it not very likely for me to ſee him again, and I had a mind to Kown from his own Mouth the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a common but much credited
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65808:14"/>ſtory, that I had heard ſo often from many others of an old Parrot he had in <hi>Braſill</hi> during his Government there, that ſpoke, and asked, and anſwered, common queſtions like a Reaſonable Cteature; ſo that thoſe of his train there, generally concluded it to be Witchery or Poſſeſſion; and one of the Chaplains, who lived long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>Holland</hi> would never from that time endure a Parrot, but ſaid they all had a Devil in them. I had heard many particulars of this Story, and aſſevered by People hard to be Diſcredited, which made me ask Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> what there was of it. He ſaid with his uſual plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dryneſs in talk, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing true, but a great deal falſe, of what had been reported. I deſired to Know of him, what there was of the firſt, he told me ſhort and coldly, that he had heard of ſuch an old Parrot when he came to <hi>Braſill;</hi> and though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved nothing of it, and it was a good way off, yet he had ſo much curioſity as as to ſend for it; that it was a very great and a very old one; and when it came firſt into the room where the Prince was with a great many Dutchmen about him, it ſaid preſently, <hi>What a company of White men are here?</hi> They askt it what<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65808:14"/>he thought that Man was? pointing at at the Prince. It anſwered, <hi>Some Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or other.</hi> When they brought it cloſe to him, he askt it, <hi>Dou venes, vous?</hi> [Whence come you?] It anſwered, <hi>De</hi> Marinnan.

I ſet down the words of this worthy Dialogue in French, juſt as Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> ſaid them to me. I asked him in what Language the Parrot ſpoke? And he ſaid in Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilian. I asked whether he underſtood Braſilian? He ſaid, no, but he had taken care to have two Interpreters by him, one a Dutch-man that ſpoke Briſilian, and the other a Briſilian that ſpoke Dutch; that he asked them ſeparately and privately, and both of them agreed in telling him juſt the ſame thing<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65808:15"/>that the Parrot ſaid. I could not (ſays Sir <hi>William</hi>) but tell this odd Story, be becauſe it is ſo much out of the way, and from the firſt hand, and what may paſs for a good one; for I dare ſay this Prince at leaſt believed himſelf in all he told me, having ever paſſed for a very honeſt and pious man.

<hi>Chapter,</hi> does caſt ſome Light on this Subject; but yet to ſet it out more fully, I will conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Ordinary Means the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſes in its Acts of Apprehenſion, and thoſe are Words.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> The immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Object of Apprehenſion, and that is Notion, or Intellectual Sentiment; Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Mind. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The two chieſ Affections of Apprehenſion, and thoſe are clearneſs and diſtinctneſs; of which three conſiderations; the Second properly is a Subject of Metaphyſicks; the Third of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick; and the Firſt is common to both.</p>
                  <p>Apprehenſion properly and primarily is of things, as things are taken largely, for (external) Objects of the Mind. By an (external) Object of the Mind, I mean whatever any wiſe is without, and thought upon by, it. Now, the mind may think upon Objects, two ways. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it may think upon them nakedly and abſtractly, as they are in themſelves, (without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them as marked and diſtinguiſhed by Words, or any other Characters and Notes, that ſhould betoken or ſignifie them,) only by having the <hi>Idea</hi> or notion of them. And this is to apprehend an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>immmediately.</hi> For example, without conſidering of the <hi>Word</hi>
[whiteneſs,] or having the leaſt thought of it, one may<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65808:16"/>conſider the <hi>Image</hi> of Whiteneſs, as ir doth appear in Snow, in Paper, or on a White wall. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> the mind may alſo think of things, and conſider them by <hi>means</hi> of Words, that ſignifie them; as when having in our thoughts the word [whiteneſs], we do not think of the thing or Image, but under that word, which ſtands for it; or perhaps do think and ſpeak of whiteneſs, without having the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of whiteneſs at all; for both <hi>ways</hi> we may think of things by means of words, ſince words may be uſed to call the Images or Notions of things into our minds, for elſe themſelves may ſtand in our minds for theſe Images or Notions, and ſo may be diſcourſed of, or uſed in the Diſcourſe of other things. This Inſtance I acknowledge is an Imaginative Apprehenſion; and I uſe it rather than another that is Intellectual, becauſe the Underſtanding in its Acts of Apprehenſion, if not always, doth very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſummon in the aid of the Imagination; as alſo, becauſe it ſerves well enough to manifeſt my meaning; which, in ſhort, is, that the mind may think on things either immediately, without the help of words; or
<hi>mediately</hi> by means of them.</p>
                  <p>Words are the Names of things, and of the Notions, Thoughts and Conceptions that we have of things. <hi>Names</hi> are Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65808:17"/>Sounds, appointed to ſignifie things and Notions.</p>
                  <p>All Articulations of Sounds, all Voices (for Articulations of Sound are call'd <hi>Voices</hi>) tho they be, or may, by compoſition and conjugation, be multiplied, almoſt to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet they are reducible within the compaſs of the Alphabet, and can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the four and twenty Letters, in their Combination; which certainly was an excellent Invention, and full of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For Words, as properly they are but Sounds, ſo, as Sounds they could not be ſpoken, and conſequently could not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, but unto perſons that are preſent, and within hearing, and to them too but for the preſent. Whereas by means of <hi>Letters,</hi> becoming capable of being perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and fix'd in <hi>Writing,</hi> they become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, both to thoſe that are preſent, and to thoſe that are abſent; even to the moſt remote, in time, and place. <hi>Again,</hi> Since
<hi>Writing</hi> is a repreſentation of our Words, as, Words of our Conceptions and Thoughts; ſo that Writings do ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and ſtand for, our Words, as Words do ſignifie, and ſtand for, our Thoughts; therefore when I do diſcourſe of Words, I would be underſtood to diſcourſe of thoſe that are written, as well as of thoſe that are ſpoken. And <hi>in fine,</hi> ſince thoughts<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65808:17"/>may be ſignified by geſtures and other Signs, as well as by Words; (for there are <hi>three</hi> ways of diſcourſing, or communicating of thoughts; to wit, by <hi>Words,</hi> by
<hi>Writing,</hi> and by meer <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Geſtures;</hi>) therefore what I ſay of <hi>Words</hi> muſt be taken as inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be equally meant, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> of Geſtures and other Signs (ſo far as they are uſed to ſignify our thoughts) as well as of words themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> of words are divers. The
<hi>Firſt,</hi> to be as ſo many marks and tokens upon things, to ſignifie and ſhow them; ſo that every man may be able to know them again in his own mind, and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and diſcern them in it.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of this uſe, it muſt be conſidered, that the Underſtanding hath not of its own, (as the Imagination hath) any
<hi>proper Images,</hi> any Figures of the things it converſes with, whereby to know or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them; the only Images it has of things (beſides thoſe of the Senſe, or the Imagination) are the <hi>Words</hi> which ſignify them; which do ſtand therein for the very things themſelves. For to give an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; There is no ſuch thing in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as an Image, or ſenſible Figure, of Subſtance, or of mind, or of matter, or of colour in general, as there is in the ſenſe, or imagination of white, of black, of red,<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65808:18"/>of green, or of other particular Colours: The
<hi>only</hi> Images it has of theſe, and of all things elſe that are purely intelligible and mental, are the <hi>Words</hi> that ſignify them: Ay, the very <hi>Ideas</hi> the Underſtanding hath of things, are nothing but its definitive conceptions of them, or <hi>definitions;</hi> and definitions as properly they are of <hi>Words</hi> (which <hi>Words</hi> ſince they ſtand in the mind for things, are commonly miſtaken for, and conſequently miſcalled, <hi>Simple Ideas</hi> of theſe things;) ſo they are made by words. To ſuch a degree, in this reſpect, are words of uſe to the underſtanding, which cannot work without them; a thing ſo certain, that even the <hi>denomination</hi> it ſelf of [<hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi>] at leaſt in part, ariſes from hence; for the <hi>Mind</hi> is called (the) Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it has a power of ſeeing things <hi>under</hi> Words that <hi>ſtand</hi> for them; as well as becauſe it has one of perceiving Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under Accidents; and had Beaſts this power, they would come but little ſhort of men, as to Acts of mind.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this uſe, (which is more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and particular, an uſe that every man muſt have of Words for himſelf) there is a <hi>Second,</hi> an uſe that men have of them one for another? to wit, mutually to expreſs their Sentiments and Thoughts; in reſpect of which, words are ſaid to be as <hi>Mony:</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65808:18"/>the meaning is, That words uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey our minds to others, muſt be ſuch as are current, and in uſe, or elſe they will not paſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Speech</hi> or Language (the cloathing of our Sentiments and Thoughts in Words) is, in reſpect of <hi>both</hi> the mentioned uſes, eſpecially the latter, of ſo much moment to <hi>Reaſon</hi> (taken for Diſcourſe, or Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at large; that ſome have conceited, that men are little beholding to any thing elſe but the <hi>former,</hi> for that degree of the <hi>Latter,</hi> that doth divide and diſtinguiſh them from Beaſts. Reaſon in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the Seeds and principles of it, being but as a Spark, which in men, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Speech, becomes improved and blown into ſuch a flame as has engroſſed the Title; ſo that tho the ſame Principles of Reaſon are common to all Animals, yet this
<hi>Improvement</hi> of them (that only carries the Name) is proper to man, becauſe Speech is. And in truth, by means of Speech, or communication of Sentiments and Thoughts, as one man becomes aſſiſted and aided by another; ſo if we do add <hi>Writing</hi> and <hi>Printing,</hi> which are but Fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Speech, it may be ſaid, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is aſſiſted and aided with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and thoughts of all; and how much help this may bring toward the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65808:19"/>of Reaſon, is nothing hard to be conceived by one that ſhall conſider the great advantage a Conſult has, for the ripening of Buſineſs, or making a judgment upon things, above the reaſoning of any one particular ſolitary perſon; or hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the difference that Cultivation and Savagenes, do make, in men. Should one permit himſelf to imagine that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, Caſtors, Dogs, Foxes, and other ſugacious Animals, which can contrive and do ſo much ſingly, (as we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they can, and do) ſhould have the united Ingeny of their ſeveral Kinds; it would be hard for him to ſay, to what they might not improve, or to diſtinguiſh the near approaches that they would make to what commonly is called Reaſon, from the real uſe and enjoyment of it. Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he alſo conſider, that Savage wild men, who want the benefit of Education, and of large Converſe; ſo that tho they have the uſe of <hi>Speech,</hi> yet they receive not this advantage by it, do very little excel ſuch Animals, but come infinitely ſhort of civilized and well bred men; who living in great Societies, have all the furtherance that aid and mutual aſſiſtance can give unto them.</p>
                  <p>Some in regard of the former uſe that <hi>Words</hi> have, do call them <hi>Notes,</hi> or Marks;<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65808:19"/>and in reſpect of the latter, term them <hi>Signs;</hi> but in truth, in referenc to both their Uſes, Words are Signs, ſince, in both, they do ſignifie, either to ones ſelf, as in the firſt uſe, or unto others, as in the ſecond. Words are
<hi>Signs,</hi> but <hi>Signs</hi> that ſignifie but by agreement, conſent, and Inſtitution: For ſhould any do it by <hi>Nature,</hi> the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that conſiſted of them would be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, ſpoken and underſtood of all, which none is: ſo that the way of tryal in <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> of the moſt Ancient Language, was as ill grounded, as the Diſcovery made by it ridiculous. 'Tis true, <hi>Jacob Behman</hi> talks of a <hi>Language</hi> of
<hi>Nature,</hi> but I think he rather intended by it the <hi>Language</hi> of
<hi>Signatures,</hi> than that of Words; ſince the <hi>Language</hi> of
<hi>Signatures,</hi> if underſtood, may be interpreted (as he affirms his
<hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> may) in <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Dutch, Engliſh,</hi> or any other vernacular Tongue: And in this ſenſe too, That
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> underſtood the <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> (as he ſays he did) was a truth, and perhaps implied in the Hiſtory, which tells us, That <hi>whatſoever</hi> Adam <hi>called every living Creature, that was the Name thereof.</hi> But tho this may be, as he ſays, yet I cannot believe that That is ſo which he adds, That <hi>Adam</hi> had the Gift [of underſtanding the <hi>Languages</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi>] which was loſt by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65808:20"/>his Fall, reſtor'd to him by his Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For that the New Birth, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in renovation of the Mind, after the Image of God in Chriſt, has any thing to do with <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or the Knowledge of Nature, is a conceit that cannot enter into my thoughts: I do not find in the Holy-Scriptures, which can give us any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty herein, that our Saviour Chriſt himſelf did teach, or that his Apoſtles and firſt followers did profeſs, Philoſophy and Science of Nature. But enough (if not too much) in this place, of the Language of <hi>Nature,</hi> ſince here we are to ſpeak of the Language of men, and the Language of men is words, which are not natural but only inſtituted and impoſed, ſigns.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of words of uſual and current ſignification is called <hi>ſpeaking;</hi> the uſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of uncurrent <hi>Fictitious</hi> words, or of current words <hi>abuſed</hi> from their uſual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſignification, to a private particular meaning, is called <hi>canting.</hi> Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort of canting <hi>Baſilides, Valentinus,</hi> and all the
<hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> in Theology; <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus, Van-Helmont,</hi> and all the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> generally, with many others, in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Medicine,</hi> are not only common, but juſtly noted, Examples. Not that the uſe of every <hi>new</hi> Word is canting, or that we need be as nice as <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65808:20"/>and avoid a new word, tho neceſſary to expreſs our meaning, as we would
<hi>Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> or <hi>Scylla.</hi> Words are but the cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Thoughts, and therefore muſt be made and fitted to them; and if we keep (as near as conveniently we can) to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Rules and Laws of Speaking, the making of new Words, when none, or none ſo apt, are ſtampt already, to ſignifie our Sentiments, is a practice that calls for imitation, ſince
<hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf has ſet us a <hi>Copy;</hi> many of the Words that how enrich the <hi>R man</hi> Language, and do make it ſo expreſſive, were Innovations of his: And <hi>Epicurus</hi> did ſo before him: For, (as

                  <p>The <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Words, if words are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, not materially, only for Articulate Sounds, but formally; for Articulate Sounds as they are Signs, do lie in their <hi>ſignification;</hi> and their

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>meaning</hi> of words (the want whereof we call <hi>Nonſenſe</hi>) is two fold; the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and
<hi>meaning</hi> of words in reference to<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65808:21"/>our common ordinary <hi>Conceptions;</hi> and the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of words in reference to the <hi>things</hi> expreſſed and ſignified by them: The former may be term'd <hi>Verbal,</hi> the latter <hi>real ſenſe;</hi> or (perhaps to ſpeak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,) the former may be called the <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>meaning</hi> of the words, the latter the

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65808:21"/>A <hi>Diſtinction</hi> then there is (and that a remarkable one too) between the verbal, and real, meaning of words; which to ſet out more fully, I will ſhow, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The the Occaſion, and Riſe of it, and then <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Uſe and Benefit of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, this diſtinction <hi>Ariſes</hi> from the Imperfection and Inadequacy of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Knowledge; we Knowing little of things but under words, and words being (immediately) the ſigns but, of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, which are always ſhort and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and, too often, indiſtinct and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. Now if the ſentiments we have according to the Vulgar and Ordinary way of conceiving, which is but general and confuſed, do cohere and hang together, when one of them is affirmed or ſpoken of another, ſo that the Notions are compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in common acceptation, we
<hi>call</hi> it ſenſe, though really the things themſelves (for which thoſe words are underſtood to ſtand) be Incompoſſible, and repugnant each to other, and therefore <hi>indeed</hi> it is Nonſenſe. This is to be better underſtood in Examples. Such <hi>Propoſitions</hi> as theſe, that
<hi>Colours</hi> (even as to their Images) are in the Objects in which they do appear; that <hi>Odours</hi> are in the things ſmelled; that <hi>Sapors</hi> are in the things that are taſted; theſe and the like Aſſertions are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65808:22"/>underſtood, or ſaid, to be Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, becauſe, Knowing in the general and confuſedly, what is meant by colour, what by Odor, and what by <hi>Sapor,</hi> as likewiſe what is meant by the thing ſeen, by the thing that is taſted, and by the thing which is ſmelled; nothing appears in thoſe confuſed general Notions (which we have,) to hinder us from thinking that Colours, Sapors, and Odours do as really Inhere in thoſe external objects, as they ſeem to do. And yet to a Perſon that hath diſtinct, real, and juſt conceptions of the ſeveral ſubjects and predicates in thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, it is evident, that 'tis as groſs and palpable <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> to affirm that Colours, Sapors, Odours, and other Accidents, (which are but <hi>Phaenomena</hi> and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings) do really exiſt in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects where they ſeem to be, as to ſay, that there are Notions and Cogitations in a Wall, in a Figg, or in a Roſe, than which there cannot be a greater Bull or abſurdity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi> of this diſtinction, is greater than moſt will think; ſince from the want of making, or of obſerving it, it comes to paſs, that ſo many do run into great miſtakes and errours, in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; <hi>Do</hi> skirmiſh one with another, to no purpoſe, and without end; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65808:22"/>
                     <hi>do</hi> differ from themſelves, as much as each from other. For few there are that do fix and ſettle even the verbal Senſe of words, (which often have a doubleneſs of meaning, and then are called <hi>Ambiguous;</hi>) and fewer that do think of the real, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which yet, they can never come to any certainty; ſo that, (as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly ſaid; words that are Wiſe Mens
<hi>Counters,</hi> become Fools <hi>Mony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning of words, as well the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, as the real, is called <hi>Senſe,</hi> becauſe the Perception of it ought to be as
<hi>Clear,</hi> and diſtinct, and as ſteady and fixt, as that of Senſe is: For words, to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as they ought, muſt have their meanings be as clearly and diſtinctly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by the mind, as objects of Senſe when they are Seen, or Heard, or Taſted, or Smelled, are by the Senſes.</p>

                  <p>I Have ſpoken of Senſe and Nonſenſe in the general; but toward a further clearing of the Notions of them, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of the latter, it muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that falſity and Nonſence are not Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonimous terms; For all <hi>Falſity</hi> is not Nonſenſe, that is, every Propoſition that is falſe, is not alſo Nonſenſical; for many things are <hi>poſſible,</hi> that are not <hi>Actual;</hi> and therefore many propoſitions that are not actually true, might have been, or may hereafter be ſo; and as what is true, is<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65808:23"/>Senſe, ſo Senſe is <hi>compoſſibility,</hi> not actuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; not that only which at preſent is true, but whatever is any wiſe poſſible to be ſo But though all Falſity is not Nonſenſe; all <hi>impoſſible</hi> Falſity is. I mean, every propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is Nonſenſe, that is falſe to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it is impoſſible (abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible) it ſhould be true; for no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is abſolutely impoſſible to be true but that which implies contradiction, and that which implies a contradiction muſt needs be Nonſenſe; ſince the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot frame any Notion or Idea of it, and ſo cannot make any real ſenſe of the words, that compoſe it. Contradiction in <hi>Terms</hi> is plain or groſs Nonſenſe, (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Bull</hi> in Engliſh, or an Abſurdity;) and where the terms in common acceptation are not Contradictory, yet if the thing they are deſigned to expreſs do really imply a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, the propoſitions, though Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Senſe, are really Nonſenſe; as in the Inſtances above.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve again, that there is in the mind a certain ſenſible <hi>Reluctance</hi> to give aſſent to Propoſitions that are Incongruous, and really Nonſenſical; for whoever Attends to what does paſs within himſelf, will be Conſcious of a <hi>Pain</hi> (as it were of diſlocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) upon a ſerious predication of Abſtracts one of another; as when he ſays, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65808:24"/>is Juſtice; or of Contraries, as when he affirms, love is hatred, and the like in other Inſtances. The
<hi>Reaſon</hi> is plain. For as this is to ſay, that one thing is another, ſo he that ſays that one thing is another, ſays alſo, that neither is it ſelf, that is, ſays a Contradiction, and a Contradiction (whither explicite or implicite,) being Affirmation and Negation of the ſame thing, and conſequently an Aſſent and Diſſent at the ſame time, and Aſſent and Diſſent being contrary Motions, or Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, it follows, that to ſay, or go about to Aſſent unto, a Contradiction, is to
<hi>diſtract</hi> and diſtort the mind, and put it to pain, becauſe it is to draw it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ways at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>Nonſenſe in perſons who pretend to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Aſſiſtances, may be called <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, Enthuſiaſm</hi> properly, is a falſe conceit of being inſpired; to be <hi>inſpired,</hi> is to receive immediate motions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts from the Spirit of God; the perſon that has this falſe conceit of his being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Inſtincted, and moved by the Spirit of God, is called an <hi>Enthuſiaſt.</hi> A perſon may be an <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> as well in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of
<hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as in thoſe of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and many Examples there are of both ſorts of Enthuſiaſts, ſome of which I have touched before; but I forbear to ſay any<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65808:24"/>more of them now, in reference to their <hi>Original,</hi> or the <hi>Quality</hi> and
<hi>Cauſes</hi> of their Diſtemper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Since now, it is not my buſineſs to treat of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and to ſet out the
<hi>Nature</hi> of it, under the Notion of an <hi>Imaginary Inſpiration,</hi> ſo much as to ſpeak of the <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> which uſually is Nonſenſe.</p>
                  <p>And of this I find a full Example in Dr. <hi>Fludd,</hi> in the third Look of his <hi>Moſaick</hi> Philoſophy, the firſt Section and fourth Chapter, when having cited the Seventh Chapter of the the Book of
<hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> the 25th, verſe. He infers in theſe terms,
<q rend="inline">'So that we may diſcern by this Diſcription of the Wiſe Man, what is the Spiritual Chriſt, who is the Wiſdom, Vertue, and word of God, and how by his Apparition out of Darkneſs, that is, by the mutation or change of the firſt principle, (which was in Darkneſs, <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi verbum in Principio,</hi>) from Dark Aleph to Light Aleph, the Waters which were contained in the profound Bowels of the Abyſs were revealed, and were anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is to ſay, by the emanation or emiſſion of this ſelf ſame Spirit of Eternal Fire or Light, and afterward by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable activity, and reſtleſs motion and penetration (for by <hi>Solomon</hi> it is ſaid to be <hi>Omnibus mobilibus mobilior,</hi> &amp;c. Sap.<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65808:25"/>7.24.) It firſt diſtinguiſheth and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth the Darkneſs from the Light, the obſcure and groſs Waters from the ſubtle and pure, and then it diſpoſeth the Heavens into Spherees; laſtly it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth the groſſer Waters into Sublunary Elements, as by the words of the firſt Chapter of
<hi>Geneſis</hi> each Man may plainly diſcern.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a full Example, and yet in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entertainment of the Curious, and for more variety. I will add another in the <hi>Magick Aphoriſms,</hi> (for ſo I find them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) of the <hi>Brethren of the Roſy-Croſs,</hi> which are as little capable of real Senſe (at leaſt in my Underſtanding,) as that I cited before from Dr. <hi>Fludd:</hi> And I will give them in the ſame Language in which I find them, without pretending to the skill of Tranſlating them exactly.</p>

The Story is to be found in a Book enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Remarkable Antiquities of the City of</hi> Exeter, <hi>pag.</hi> 42, 43.) and is this;
<q rend="inline">'<hi>Henry Tracy,</hi> an Inhabitant of the City aforeſaid, had a numerous Iſſue, being the Father of eight Sons, and eight Daughters; the the Sixth and Seventh Sons were of one Birth
<hi>Twins,</hi> and ſo well like in a all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and ſo equal in Stature, ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured in Hair, and ſo like in Face and Geſtures, that they could not be known one from the other, no not by their Friends, Parents, Brothers or Siſters, but privately by ſome ſecret marks, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by wearing ſome ſeveral coloured Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands alike, which in ſport they would ſometimes exchange to make tryal of their Friends Judgment; yet ſomewhat more ſtrange was, that their <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were
<hi>as one,</hi> for what the one loved,<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65808:27"/>the other deſired; and ſo on the contrary; the loathing of any thing by the
<hi>one,</hi> was the diſtaſting of the ſame thing by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yea, ſuch a conſideration, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Power or Sympathy was in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that if <hi>Nicholas</hi> were ſick or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Andrew</hi> felt the like pain, (tho' far <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> and remote in their perſons, and that too, without any intelligence given to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party;) and 'twas alſo obſerved that if <hi>Andrew</hi> were merry, <hi>Nicholas</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo affected, altho' in different places which long they could not endure to be aſunder; for they ever deſired to eat, drink, ſleep and walk together; yea, ſo they lived and died, for they both ſerved the King in Arms againſt his <hi>Barons;</hi> and in a Battle, the one being ſlain, the other ſtept preſently into his place; where in the height of danger (no perſwaſions able to remove or hinder him) was there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe killed.</q>

<hi>nature</hi> of a Queſtion, nor belongs unto it as ſuch, but rather is contrary, and only ſprings from the <hi>manner</hi> of putting the Queſtion. I will give an Example in each: This <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi> Is not Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God? may be called <hi>Affirmative,</hi> becauſe, being made in that manner, it ſeems to imply, that he who puts it, would have the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to be, he is; and this is Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God? eſpecially as it is <hi>toned</hi> in pronouncing, may be termed a
<hi>Negative</hi> Queſtion, becauſe it ſeems to imply, he is not. But then either way of propoſing the Queſtion, is not barely the
<hi>putting</hi> a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> but alſo a directing the
<hi>Anſwer:</hi> For to make a fair and naked Queſtion, it ſhould be worded thus; Whether Jeſus Chriſt be the Son of God? elſe it may be only verbally a Queſtion, but in effect an Aſſertion. <hi>Quaeſtio</hi> (ſays <hi>Cicero, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Quaeſt.</hi>) <hi>eſt Appetitio Cognitionis, Quaeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſque finis Inventio.</hi>

                  <p>But to ſhow how lt comes to paſs, that there are (as there are) appearances as if the mind had ſome original innate Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which for that reaſon are called <hi>Prolep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and Anticipations, and withal to bring ſome light to the buſineſs of Apprehenſion,<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65808:30"/>which (as to the <hi>way</hi> of it) is obſcure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and but ſeldom touched to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: I will offer an Obſervation very common, but (as it may be applied) very luciferous in reference to this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>Every body obſerves, that if a Blow is aimed at the Head of any perſon, he will hold up his Arm to receive it, and keep it from his head, without thinking either <hi>that,</hi> or <hi>why,</hi> he does ſo; and this is ſaid to be done <hi>Naturally,</hi> and by inſtinct; becauſe, in truth, it is done without premeditation, and ſo at that time, without any actual conceived deſign.</p>
                  <p>And yet again it is certain, that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant will not do ſo, or any Child before it has been taught and inſtructed to do it; which makes it plain, that the doing ſo in thoſe who are come to reaſon, is no effect of natural inſtinct, but of uſe; only the Child was taught to do it ſo early, that by the time he comes to the Age of Diſcretion, having forgotten, or rather, having made no obſervation, when it was firſt taught, or firſt did it, and upon what Motives, and doing it now <hi>without deliberation</hi> it hath the aſpect of a thing effected by <hi>Nature,</hi> and not of a
<hi>cuſtom</hi> or habit.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner in the buſineſs of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> we may, and often do proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65808:31"/>Principles inſtilled into us very <hi>early,</hi> and are Acted by them, without Knowing
<hi>how,</hi> or <hi>why,</hi> it being no Effect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſideration. <hi>Experience</hi> confirms this, ſince we may be certain, if we do but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to our own Actions, that, many times, we are carried to the Affection, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection of things, and the Approbation or Diſapprobation of them, we Know not <hi>why,</hi> and yet all the paſſions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Mind, have <hi>Reaſons</hi> for them; for all Effects muſt have <hi>Cauſes;</hi> but <hi>theſe,</hi> ſometimes, are ſo <hi>early</hi> graffed in us, and, at other times, ſo
<hi>unawares,</hi> that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not they were ſo; and then the
<hi>Effects,</hi> only being obſerved, and the cauſes lying deep, hidden and ſecret, we do call it <hi>Nature,</hi> or Inſtinct, though in truth, it be <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and habit, as much as any thing elſe is.</p>
                  <p>Again, much the ſame way we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute or <hi>reckon;</hi> for when we uſe any greater numbers, either in Addition, or in Subſtraction, or in any other Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal operation, we do it without any actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſideration of what the leſſer particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar numbers are that make the greater, for that we have done before, (perhaps long,) and conſequently are poſſeſſed of the <hi>Ideas</hi> (may I ſo expreſs it) without the <hi>Images</hi> of them. But at firſt, we had
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65808:31"/>a particular Knowledge. As, when we Multiply and ſay, Six and Six is Twelve, and Twelve and Twelve is Four and Twenty, we do it without conſidering actually at that time, that ſix is ſo many unites, though at firſt (but poſſibly ſo long ago that we do not remember it) we did ſo, and muſt (do ſo) to Know the particular value of that number; and the like is of others.</p>
                  <p>And thus alſo with an eaſie Application may it be conceived, <hi>how words come to ſtand in the mind for things,</hi> and that when we have the <hi>word,</hi> we think we have the ſimple <hi>Idea</hi> of the thing; it is juſt as the Figure [6] doth ſtand for the number [Six.] And that when once we have had a diſtinct Idea or Notion of the
<hi>Number,</hi> afterward, (without actual thinking thereof,) we uſe the Figure inſtead of it, and that as well, or better than if we did diſtinctly conſider the Number it ſelf. Now, words do carry the ſame Relation unto things, that Figures do unto Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and both Words and Figures ſeem to derive the power which they have of ſtanding in the Mind as Repreſentatives, from the connexion they have, Figures with Numbers, and Words with Things; after the ſame manner as we hold up our Arm, or a Stick, to ſave our Head, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65808:32"/>thinking of ſaving it. For though the Action prevents all actual thought of the End of it, yet 'tis done for an End, in vertue of it its firſt <hi>Direction</hi> and Uſe. This Diſcourſe attended to, and well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, will open a great light into the <hi>way</hi> in which the Underſtanding comes to have Apprehenſion of things by the means of Words; and to form its Ideas and Notions, taking Notions largely for <hi>any</hi> Thoughts or Conceptions.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the former Senſe of the Word [Notion,] there is <hi>Another</hi> which is more Reſtrained and Limited; in which a Notion is <hi>Modus Concipiendi,</hi> a certain particular <hi>manner</hi> of conceiving; a manner of conceiving things that corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponds not to them but only as they are <hi>Objects,</hi> not as they are <hi>Things;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every Conception ſome thing that is purely <hi>Objective,</hi> purely Notional; in ſo much that few, if any, of the Ideas which we have of things are properly <hi>Pictures;</hi> our Conceptions of things no more reſembling them in ſtrict Propriety, than our Words do our Conceptions, for which yet they do ſtand, and with which they have a Kind of Correſpondence and Anſwering: juſt as Figures that do ſtand for Numbers; yet are no wiſe like them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:65808:32"/>To make this clearer, it muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the <hi>Eye</hi> has no perception of things but under the
<hi>Appearance</hi> of Light, and Colours, and yet Light and Colours do not really exiſt in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that are perceived and ſeen by means or them, but are only in the Eye. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Ear</hi> has no perceivance of things, as of a Bell, of a Lute, or of a Viol, but under ſounds, and yet ſound is only a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent in the Ear that hears, and is not, or any thing like it, in the Bell, or Viol, or Lute that is heard. For as the Eye has no Perceivance of things but under <hi>Colours</hi> that are not in them, (and the ſame time with due alteration, muſt be ſaid of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senſes.) So the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not things, or any Habitudes or Aſpects of them, but under <hi>Certain Notions</hi> that neither have that being in Objects, or that being of Objects, that they ſeem to have; but are, in all reſpects, the very ſame to the mind or Underſtanding, that Colours are to the Eye, and Sound to the Ear. To be more particular, the Uunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceives not any thing but under the Notion of an
<hi>Enity,</hi> and this either a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> or an
<hi>Accident;</hi> Under that of a <hi>whole,</hi> ore of a <hi>part;</hi> or of a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> or of an <hi>Effect,</hi> or the like; and yet all theſe and the like, are only <hi>Entities of Reaſon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65808:33"/>within the mind, that have no more of any real true Exiſtence without it, than Colours have without the Eye, or Sounds without the Ear. Every perſon that hath the leaſt Underſtanding of the way in which we do apprehend things, will yield this to be true as to <hi>Whole</hi> and <hi>Part,</hi> to <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Effect,</hi> and to all the
<hi>Notions</hi> which are commonly termed by Logicians the <hi>Second;</hi> and it is as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true in reference to <hi>Subſtance</hi> and
<hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> to <hi>Quantity, Quality,</hi> and thoſe other
<hi>General Notions</hi> under which the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding apprehends its Objects, though commonly they are called <hi>Firſt</hi> ones, and in compariſon of the others are ſo.</p>
                  <p>I have laboured the more to make the Notion that I have in this buſineſs plain and eaſie, becauſe much of what is to be ſaid hereafter will depend upon it; and now taking it for granted that my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is <hi>Intelligible.</hi> what remains, is to evince <hi>true;</hi> and this I ſhall do, from the very Nature of Cogitation in general, (as it comprehends Senſation as well as Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,) ſince that the Underſtanding doth
<hi>Pinn</hi> its Notions upon Objects, ariſes not from its being
<hi>Such</hi> a particular Kind of Cogitative Faculty, but from its being Cogitative <hi>at large;</hi> let us then reflect<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65808:33"/>again on the Nature of Cogitation at large.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that things to us Men are nothing but as they do ſtand in our <hi>Analogy</hi> that is, in plain terms, they are nothing to us but as they are known by us; and as certain, that they ſtand not in our Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, nor are Known by us, but as they are in our Faculties, in our Senſes, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, or Mind; and they are not in our Faculties, either in their own <hi>realities,</hi> or by way of a true <hi>Reſemblance</hi> and
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,</hi> but only in reſpect of certain
<hi>Appearances</hi> or Sentiments, which, by the various impreſſions that they make upon us, they do either Occaſion only, or Cauſe, or (which is moſt probable) concur unto in Cauſing with our Faculties. Every Cogitative Faculty, though it is not the Sole Cauſe of its own immediate [appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant] Object, yet has a ſhare in making it: Thus the Eye or Viſive Faculty hath a ſhare in making the Colours which it is ſaid to ſee; the Ear or Auditive Power, a ſhare in producing ſounds, which yet it is ſaid to hear; the Imagination has a part in making the Imagies ſtored in it; and there is the ſame Reaſon for the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that it ſhould have a like ſhare in framing the <hi>Primitive Notions</hi> under which it takes in and receives Objects: In<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65808:34"/>ſumm, the <hi>immediate Objects</hi> of cogitation, as it is exerciſed by men, are <hi>entia cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> all Phaenomena; Appearances that do no more exiſt without our faculties in the things themſelves, than the Images that are ſeen in water, or behind a glaſs, do really exiſt in thoſe places where they ſeem to be.</p>
                  <p>But as this is a truth that Many will admit with more facility in reference to the Objects of Senſe, and Imagination, as Colours, Sapors, Sounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Than to thoſe of the Mind or Underſtanding, ſuch as Subſtance, Accident, Quality, Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So I find my ſelf obliged to give a farther <hi>demonſtration</hi> that it holds in theſe, as well as in thoſe; which I hope to do by the following Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the underſtanding converſes not with things ordinarily but by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the ſenſe, and ſince ſentiments of ſenſe are but Appearances, not Pictures, or proper Repreſentations, it is hard to conceive how ſuch conceptions are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med only by their occaſion, and only wrought out of them, ſhould be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits of the things themſelves, and made juſt and exact to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The underſtanding is a power<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65808:34"/>of that nature that many think it doth not immediately Attinge (as they call it) or reach particular ſingular beings, which yet are the only beings that compoſe the Univerſe, as members or parts of it; and really, it uſes to proceed by way of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,</hi> and therefore doth more Conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally converſe with Univerſals, that are not of Mundane exiſtence, than with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars that are. Now, ſince things as they are in the mind, do undergo an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction</hi> and ſublimation, certain it is, they muſt put on another dreſs there, and ſo appear in quite another ſhape than that they have in the World. In ſhort, All Agree that our conceptions of things are but <hi>inadequate,</hi> as indeed they muſt needs be, ſince things have much Refraction (may I ſo expreſs it) both before they come, and after that they come, to the mind; and if they are inadequate, they cannot be commenſurate, that is, they cannot bo ſo juſt and exact, to things, as to ſhow them as they be, and in their own exiſtences.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It may be Argued from the very nature of an
<hi>Idea</hi> or notion; ſince this after a ſort is a ſentiment of the mind, as a ſentiment (properly ſo called) is, after a ſort, an
<hi>Idea</hi> or Notion of the ſenſe; the<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65808:35"/>immediate objects of the ſenſe are <hi>ſenſible</hi> ſentiments, and thoſe of the underſtanding are <hi>Intellectual</hi> ones; which they muſt needs be, becauſe the underſtanding it ſelf is a kind of ſenſe, only a more ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and raiſed. <hi>Mens ipſa</hi> (ſays <hi>Cicero, l.</hi> 4.
<hi>Academ. Quaeſt.</hi>) <hi>quae ſenſuum fons eſt, etiam ipſa Senſus eſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In fine, this is ſo certain a truth, that whoſoever reflects, tho' never ſo little, cannot chuſe but obſerve, that as he takes in nothing by his ſenſe but under <hi>ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which are the <hi>notions</hi> of ſenſe, ſo he receives in nothing in his underſtanding, but under <hi>certain notions,</hi> which are the
<hi>ſentiments</hi> of the mind; ſince he knows nothing Intellectually but either in general only, under the notion of a <hi>thing,</hi> or more ſpecially under that of a <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> or elſe of an
<hi>Accident;</hi> and what are all theſe but <hi>Objective Notions?</hi> as will appear in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular upon the examination and Tryal of them.</p>
                  <p>Let us then inquire <hi>firſt</hi> into the <hi>thing,</hi> (for we ſhall ſhew it of <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> hereafter) and what is thing but <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus concipiendi?</hi> a notion or ſentiment that the mind has, of whatſoever any wiſe is, becauſe it is? Thing indeed is the moſt <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> notion, but then it is but a
<hi>notion,</hi> becauſe it is general; and has the moſt of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65808:35"/>a notion, becauſe it is the moſt general. To be more particular; If the Queſtion be asked, <hi>what thing</hi> is? or what is meant by that word? <hi>Some</hi> have no other Anſwer but this, that a thing is <hi>that which hath eſſence.</hi> But then it may be farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, what is meant by <hi>eſſence,</hi> which is ſaid to be had? What it is to
<hi>have</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? And what is meant by <hi>that,</hi> which hath it? Or if it be ſaid, that a thing is <hi>that, which is,</hi> (as it is by others;) the ſame difficulties again occur: for it may be demanded, what
<hi>that</hi> is, which is? And what is meant, when it is ſaid to
<hi>be?</hi> And whether Exiſtence be Eſſence? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince Exiſtence ſeems not the firſt conception of a thing; but is a ſecond, or after-conception; as not being that, which makes a thing to be what it is,
[a thing;] but what only makes it a thing in being.</p>
                  <p>By this, it plainly appears, that the meaning of the word
[<hi>thing,</hi>] is but an <hi>inadequate</hi> conception, ariſing in the mind upon its converſing with <hi>Objects,</hi> and ſo doth ſpeak a certain particular ſentiment, which the mind has of <hi>them;</hi> a ſentiment better underſtood, than defined by words; but a ſentiment too, that doth not enter us into the knowledge of the Reality it ſelf (may I ſo expreſs it,) of <hi>that</hi> which is; <hi>which</hi> we only apprehend
<hi>inadequately,</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:65808:36"/>under the Diſguiſe and Maſquerade of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As, that it is <hi>that,</hi> which is; or
<hi>that</hi> which has eſſence; or the like; but not by any adequate exact conception. And as for <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Accident,</hi> which yet are the firſt ſteps we make toward a diſtinct Perceivance and knowledge of things; what are they, but likewiſe <hi>Modi concipiendi?</hi> Entities of Reaſon, or notions, that (it is true) are not without <hi>grounds,</hi> but yet that have, themſelves, no Formal being but only in the <hi>Mind,</hi> that frames them; there being no ſuch thing in the World as a
<hi>Subſtance,</hi> or an <hi>Accident,</hi> any more than ſuch a thing as a <hi>Subject,</hi> or an <hi>Adjunct;</hi> and yet we apprehend not any thing but as one of theſe, to wit, as a Subſtance, or as an Accident; ſo that we apprehend not any at all, juſt as they are, in their own realities, but only under the Top-knots and Dreſſes of Notions, which our minds do put on them.</p>
                  <p>But here it will be told me, that plain unlearned men, who yet do exerciſe the Acts of Reaſoning well enough, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the beſt manner, as doing it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Art,</hi> and in a way the moſt agreeable to
<hi>Nature,</hi> do conceive and ſpeak of things without conceiving or minding of Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch as I have mention'd; for they conceive and ſpeak of <hi>man,</hi> of <hi>good</hi> and<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65808:36"/>
                     <hi>evil,</hi> of
<hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>vice,</hi> and the like, without conceiving or minding of <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or <hi>Accidents.</hi> But this is eaſily got over. For tho' unlearned plain men do not explicitely and in terms denominate
<hi>goodneſs, vertue, vice, &amp;c.</hi> Accidents, yet ſince they do conceive them (as All do) all things that <hi>are in</hi> a man, or in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, tho' they do not call them Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, yet do they conceive them
<hi>as</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents: And when they do conceive, or ſay of a <hi>man,</hi> for inſtance, that he is <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> or <hi>vicious,</hi> or the like, they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to have <hi>vertue</hi> or vice <hi>in</hi> him; that is, tho' they do not think of the <hi>name ſubſtance,</hi> yet they do really conceive that perſon to be <hi>one;</hi> ſince a ſubſtance is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>ſubject,</hi> or a thing that has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in it as Accidents; whereas in truth, neither Accident, nor Subſtance hath any being but only in the mind, and by the only vertue of cogitation or thought.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Inferences from the former Diſcourſe; firſt, that human knowledge for the moſt part is but intentional, not real. The uſefulneſs of this Inference; an Objection againſt it removed. (And yet) Secondly, That the immediate Objects of the cogitative Powers are ſomewiſe external to thoſe powers; and this, both as to appearances, (which is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly demonſtrated) and as to their grounds. Two other Inferences added; the firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the grounds of the Doctrine of the old Academy; the ſecond concerning the obligation we are under ordinarily to conceive and ſpeak of things as they are in our Analogy, and do appear to our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Infer from the former Diſcourſe; Firſt, that human knowledge (at leaſt for the moſt part) is but Intentional, not Real; and that we have no Perception of any thing, (in any degree to ſpeak of,)
<hi>juſt as it is</hi> in its own Reality and being. For all our notions and conceptions of things, are of them under <hi>ſentiments;</hi> the underſtanding it ſelf (as I argued before)<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65808:37"/>being but a higher and more ſublimated <hi>ſenſe;</hi> and ſentiments (as ſuch) are in their own <hi>formalities</hi> but <hi>apparently</hi> only, not exiſtently, without the faculties that do conceive them. To be be particular, we have no perception or knowledge of any thing but as it is a Subſtance, or an Accident, or a Quality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe are only notions: for example, as to <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> we have no knowledge of it by all, or any of our ſenſes, what really it is in it ſelf, juſt as it is, and abſolutely ſpeaking; for we are utterly ignorant (otherwiſe than by Conjecture) of the Magnitude and ſize of the little parts that compoſe it; Ignorant of their figure and ſhape; and Ignorant alſo of the kind, and degree of motion they have; all this we are Ignorant of, and yet this is all that is Real in Water But as Ignorant as we are of what it <hi>really</hi> is, in it ſelf, and abſolutely conſidered, we have much <hi>Comparative</hi> Relative Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; for we know it by ſenſe to be fluid; to have ſome degree of tenacity or viſcoſity; to be moiſt; in a word, to have ſo many Qualities (for ſo we conceive and ſpeak) that all put together, do give the mind a ſufficient riſe to diſtinguiſh it, as a different ſubſtance, from Earth, or Fire; So that a perſon that has at any time had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65808:38"/>the perception of them all, will not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake them afterward, one for the other.</p>
                  <p>But here it muſt be remembred, that (as I have ſhewed before) tho' we do not ſee the <hi>reality</hi> of things immediately, and juſt as it is in the things themſelves, yet by means of ſentiments and notions, we do, ſomewiſe, perceive <hi>it:</hi> as the Eye that ſees not any thing immediately but Light or Colours, yet by means of Light and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, diſcerns Gold, Silver, Stones, Wood, as alſo the Magnitudes, the Figures, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the diſtances of things; with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Realities, ſo the underſtanding diſcerns infinite Realities, infinite habitudes of things; not indeed immediately, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the ſentiments of ſenſe, or by means of its own, which I call notions; as of Subſtance, Quality, Cauſe, Effect, Whole, Part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have been ſomewhat longer in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Inference, becauſe to know the <hi>nature</hi> of our Knowledge, muſt needs be of great advantage unto us; and much relieve us in our Inquiry after the nature of Things; ſince it frees us from the confuſion, that our mind muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be in, ſhould it take the Apparitions of things (for ſuch ſentiments and notions are) to be external and real Exiſtences. Would not a thinking man be much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65808:38"/>to make a ſatisfying conception, what that Image is, that he ſees in a glaſs, or in water, if he was perſwaded of its being a Reality (of Exiſtence,) and not a meer Apparition? The like muſt he be, who takes Objective Notions for
<hi>real</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtences, and who confounds <hi>Attributes</hi> that are only Objective, and that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to things but as they are Objects with thoſe that do belong unto them as they are Things, and that are Real,</p>
                  <p>However, it will not follow, as ſome have weakly Objected, that then nothing is Real; for tho' the Images themſelves of Whiteneſs, Blackneſs, Redneſs, Greenneſs, that do <hi>ſeem inherent</hi> in viſible Objects, are not really ſo, yet really there are Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and textures of particles in thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that, by the various Modifications which they give the Light, do occaſion in the Eye, to which the Light is reflected, all that diverſity of ſentiments (which we call colours) that does appear in thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The ſame, <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> muſt be ſaid of ſounds, ſapors, odors, and of Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible qualities, and in proportion will hold alſo in mental notions. For tho' the very Notions of Entity, Subſtance, Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Whole, Part, Cauſe, Effect, and the like, do not really exiſt without the mind; yet as they do
<hi>ſeem,</hi> Real, and ſome<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65808:39"/>more Real than others, ſo <hi>really</hi> they have in things without us certain <hi>grounds</hi> or Foundations, that, upon our converſe with theſe things, do naturally Occaſion, or Excite, ſuch notions and ſentiments in us. But I will ſpeak to this matter more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly; becauſe it is of importance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the <hi>immediate</hi> Objects of Cogitation, both the Senſitive, and the Intellectual, are, in <hi>appearance, external</hi> to their ſeveral faculties; that is, ſuch Objects do ſo
<hi>ſeem</hi> to be without their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral faculties, to which they correſpond, <hi>that,</hi> in appearance, they are either the very
<hi>ultimate Objects</hi> themſelves of thoſe faculties, or, at leaſt, do
<hi>Exiſt</hi> in them, and upon this account are called <hi>Objects;</hi> for Whiteneſs <hi>ſeems</hi> to the Eye to be <hi>in</hi> ſnow, or in a white wall; and ſound to the Ear, to be in the Air; a Man doth ſeem to the underſtanding, to be really a Subſtance, or a thing that is inveſted with Accidents.</p>
                  <p>If it be <hi>Inquired</hi> how it comes to paſs, that ſentiments and notions, which really are not in the things that are without us, do yet appear as if they were, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that they ſeem to be Objects? it muſt be <hi>Anſwered,</hi> that this ariſes from the very nature of cogitation it ſelf, and of<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65808:39"/>the cogitative faculties; and that both Reaſon and Experience do evidence, it muſt be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſheweth that it muſt be ſo; for as we are conſcious that we have a perceivance of Objects under certain Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Notions, ſo we are <hi>not</hi> conſcious of any Action by which our faculties ſhould make thoſe Images or Notions; and therefore being ſenſible that we are Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſuch Images, and Notions, ſo long <hi>as,</hi> and no longer <hi>than</hi> we do Attend to things without us, (which things are therefore called <hi>Objects;</hi>) and not being ſenſible that we are ſo by any Action from within our ſelves, it cannot but appear unto us that we are Affected <hi>only</hi> from the things without us, and ſo, what really is only in our ſelves, muſt <hi>ſeem</hi> to come from thoſe things, and conſequently to be really in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Experience</hi> alſo ſhews; (to wit, that what is
<hi>really</hi> but in the cogitative faculty, does yet <hi>ſeem</hi> without it;) for if the Eye by any accident becomes infected with <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi> as, (to inſtance in a more received, than often experienced, Matter,) with
<hi>yellow,</hi> by the yellow Jaundice, or with <hi>Green,</hi> (as I have ſometimes obſerved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of Convulſions;) that is,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65808:40"/>(for this is the Reality) if the Viſive Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or whatever other parts of the Eye, that are immediately concerned in the Act of Viſion, be Preter-naturally put into the ſame motions with thoſe, which by the Impreſſions of Yellow or Green Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects they are naturally put into, in either of theſe Caſes, the <hi>Object</hi> beheld by <hi>that</hi> Eye, will appear as yellow, or green, tho' to every bodies elſe, it is but White, or Red, or of ſome other colour. And whence comes this, but hence? that the Images conceived in the Eye, for in the Inſtances alledged, the Images of yellow and green are no where elſe,) are naturally <hi>pinned</hi> upon the Object. As is farther evident in <hi>Dazling;</hi> which is, when an Impreſſion made upon the Eye by one Object, becomes tranſlated to another; thus, coming out of a bright Sun-ſhine, on a Summers day, into a darkiſh room, one ſees a <hi>ſplendor</hi> in every corner, and upon every Object. The like Appearance there is, upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of Objects thro' tinctur'd <hi>Glaſſes:</hi> So that it muſt be concluded, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Objects of cogitation, I mean the very Images and ſentiments that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, do, to all <hi>appearance,</hi> ſeem as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal to the cogitative powers, as even the ultimate Objects themſelves, that are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65808:40"/>perceived under them; which was the firſt thing to be ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point to be ſhewed is, that the immediate Objects of cogitation are external in their <hi>ground,</hi> as well as in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and in truth, are therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal in appearance, becauſe they are ſo <hi>really</hi> in their grounds. And this is as certain, as that every Effect muſt have a Cauſe. For <hi>things without us,</hi> are the Cauſes that do excite ſuch Images and Notions <hi>in</hi> us: In the order of Nature, we do <hi>ſee</hi> a thing ſo long <hi>as,</hi> and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<hi>than,</hi> we keep our Eye upon it; and therefore that we do ſee it, muſt come from ſome <hi>impreſſion</hi> from the Thing; and ſince to
<hi>ſee</hi> a thing, is nothing but to have ſome Image <hi>from</hi> it, and ſo <hi>of</hi> it, in the Eye, and the Image is as the Impreſſion, and the Impreſſion as the Thing that makes it, it follows that the
<hi>grounds</hi> of the Image is in the Thing without us. And ſince the Image (by which I mean Light or Colour) is the immediate object of
<hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and, that what is inſtanced in one Act of cogitation, will equally hold in all, it follows, that the immediate Objects of all other cogitations, as well as of viſion, are ordinarily and naturally as external in their <hi>grounds,</hi> as in <hi>appearance;</hi> that is, are fundamentally external, as well as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:65808:41"/>I thought once to have ended this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here, but now before I do ſo, I will add an Inference or two from the former Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; the firſt is, that we learn from it the <hi>Foundation</hi> of that Opinion the <hi>Academicks</hi> of old were in, That <hi>no judgment could be made of Truth;</hi> that things do ſeem to us, but cannot be perceived by us; and that no <hi>certainty,</hi> but great <hi>probability</hi> only, is to be Attained unto by men. For as this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion had all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of cogitation to give it countenance, ſo thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſaw it; for they evidently perceived, that they ſaw not the Realities, but only the Appearances of things; <hi>Plato</hi> the chief of them, one of the moſt penetrating, as well as the moſt elegant, of all that ever were, affirmed that the preſent, was a word, of <hi>Veri ſimilitude only,</hi> and not of Truth and Reality; That the beings in this World were only
<hi>Shadows,</hi> but that the <hi>Subſtances</hi> themſelves were in the
<hi>Ideal.</hi> How far herein he went with the Truth, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perceived by what I have diſcourſed before, concerning the Nature of Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as alſo, where he ſtrikes out.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Inference is, That ſince Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and Notions bottomed upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, do ſeem, the former to the Senſe, the latter to the Underſtanding, to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities; and ſince we are obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65808:41"/>and ſpeak, of things, ordinarily and popularly (for all are not Philoſophers) in that way and manner that they ſeem to be; it follows, that we are obliged to conceive, and ſpeak of Sentiments and Notions in Common Converſation, and to the people, <hi>as if</hi> really they were the things themſelves that are perceived; or at leaſt were in them: And ſo may ſay, the Snow is white, the Emerald is green, and the like.</p>

                  <p>For that which any wiſe <hi>is,</hi> is either without the thinking of any one upon it; or it is no longer than while one is a thinking, and becauſe he is a thinking, on it.</p>
                  <p>That which is without the thinking of any one upon it, and whether it be minded or no, is a <hi>real</hi> Thing, or a Reality; a thing that ſo is in the world, as that it is a part, or Appurtenance of it, and ſuch a thing is <hi>matter,</hi> and every Affection, and every Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of matter; and ſuch a thing alſo is Mind.</p>
                  <p>That which no longer is than while one is a thinking, and becauſe he is a thinking, on it; [ſo that tho it have that which is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65808:43"/>called in the Schools an objective being, a being in the Cogitative Faculties, yet hath none without them in the World:] this I name a
<hi>Cogitable;</hi> a Cngitable thing, or Entity. And thus, all the
<hi>Sentiments</hi> of Senſe, thoſe of the Mind, and even meer Objective Notions, are Things, not things of Mundane and External Exiſtence, but of Cogitation and Notion; Intentional, not Real things. For ſuch are Colours, Sounds, Sapors, Time, Place, Subſtance, Accident, Cauſe, Effect;
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional</hi> things, things that, as ſuch, have only an <hi>eſſe Objectivum,</hi> an <hi>eſſe Cognitum,</hi> as the Schoolmen phraſe it.</p>
                  <p>Cogitables, or Things that have being only in the Faculties that apprehend them, and by vertue of their being apprehended, are of
<hi>two</hi> ſorts; For either they have a being in <hi>Faculties</hi> by means of the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made upon <hi>them</hi> from external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and conſequently have <hi>Grounds</hi> and Foundations in the things that are without us; or, they have a being in our Faculties, only by a working of the Faculties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without any ſuch Grounds.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Cogitables, that have being by means of Impreſſions made upon our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, by External Objects, I call <hi>Real Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitables;</hi> Cogitables, becauſe the being which they have, is,
<hi>formally</hi> a being in<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65808:44"/>Cogitation only; Real Cogitables, becauſe they have Grounds and Foundations, in things that are Real. Thus the <hi>Sentiments</hi> of Senſe, ſuch as Colours, Sounds,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Fundamental Notions</hi> of Mind, thoſe <hi>of</hi> things, and thoſe <hi>about</hi> them, ſuch as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Accident, Cauſe, Effect, Whole, Part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Real Cogitables; Cogitables, for that the very Images themſelves, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Ideas,</hi> are Entities only of Cogitation, as having but an <hi>eſſe cognitum;</hi> and Real Cogitables, becauſe they have <hi>Grounds,</hi> in things that are Real; for, antecedently to any Operation of the mind concerning theſe Cogitables, there do really exiſt, in the world, Things that in their own natures are fitted to produce, or to occaſion them in our Faculties, in a certain correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Real Cogitables are either</hi> properly <hi>ſo, or but</hi> reductively.</p>
                  <p>Real Cogitables <hi>proper,</hi> are ſuch things as have being in our Faculties, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of External Cauſes, that are
<hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> as well as Cauſes, of the Acts that make thoſe Cogitables. And theſe are of two ſorts. For Example, (for things of this nature are beſt conceived in Examples) there is <hi>Greenneſs</hi> in Graſs, as alſo in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merauld,<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65808:44"/>and there is
<hi>Bowedneſs</hi> in an Oar, or a Staff, that is in the Water, ſo, as that part of it is in, part out: Now <hi>both theſe</hi> [the <hi>Greens</hi> and the <hi>Bowedneſs</hi>] are but Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, or <hi>Poenomena;</hi> and having equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (one as much as another) their Grounds and Foundations in the things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal to our Faculties, both are <hi>equally</hi> Real; and yet every one that conſiders muſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they are of very different natures, and that Bowedneſs is Not, in all reſpects, of the ſame ſort of Appearance that Green is, as to its General Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The differences that are in ſuch Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, depend upon the differences that are in their <hi>Grounds,</hi> and therefore muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for from theſe.</p>
                  <p>Some Appearances there are, that do <hi>Ariſe</hi> from ſenſation (for I will begin with <hi>thoſe of ſenſe</hi>) when it is made with all the Conditions and Circumſtances that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, to make it <hi>Right;</hi> and theſe I call <hi>Connatural</hi> Appearances; ſuch as the <hi>Greens</hi> in Graſs, or in an Emerauld: But there are others that ariſe from ſenſation when it is not made with all the Conditions and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that are requiſite to its being right and natural; as, when Viſion is made thro' a double <hi>Medium,</hi> a thicker and a thinner; and theſe Appearances I call <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:65808:45"/>of which ſort is that of <hi>Bowedneſs</hi> in the Oar, or Staff. Theſe Appearances I call, the former Connatural, the latter Preternatural; not in reference to Nature as it is taken for the complex of all, or any, Cauſes; (for in relation to their proper Cauſes, all Effects are equally natural;) but as Nature is taken in a more reſtrained ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſenſe (of which more hereafter) for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>particular</hi> order of Cauſes and Effects.</p>
                  <p>As for the Colours in a <hi>Rainbow;</hi> thoſe of a
<hi>Pigeons neck,</hi> and others of like nature, <hi>tho'</hi> they are commonly call'd <hi>Apparent</hi> and Emphatical, and by that Denomination di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in <hi>School Philoſophy,</hi> from thoſe that are Real and Exiſtent; yet I think not fit to make another <hi>Claſſis</hi> for them. For thoſe fugitive <hi>changeable</hi> Colours, tho' they are not ſo fix'd and permanent as others are, yet they are as Real, and as Connatural as they; the fugitive waving Colours of <hi>Changeable Taffata,</hi> and thoſe of ſtanding <hi>Corn</hi> (while Green) Agitated and waved by the wind, are equally as real and Conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, as the certain fixed Colour in Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Cloth, or in Purple. Only, tho' all theſe Colours are equally Real, as having cauſes of their Appearance that are equally real, and all equally Connatural, becauſe All (alike) are Reſults of ſenſations duly made, with all their requiſite Circumſtances; yet, ſince<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65808:45"/>their Cauſes are not equally permanent and fixed, but ſome are more, ſome leſs; it follows, that ſome of theſe Colours are more abiding and permanent, and ſome but <hi>Tranſient</hi> and <hi>Fugitive;</hi> for all Effects muſt be, as their Cauſes Are. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid concerning Real Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables of
<hi>Senſe,</hi> as to their Diſtribution, may likewiſe be ſaid of thoſe of the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> that ſome are Connatural, ſome Preternatural: Thoſe I call Connatural that reſult in the Underſtanding when it has all the requiſite Conditions and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and theſe
<hi>Preternatural,</hi> that ariſe from the working of the Underſtanding when it wants at leaſt ſome of the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Conditions and Circumſtances; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, when it is <hi>Prejudiced,</hi> or not well
<hi>Ballaſted</hi> with Obſervations, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made by ſenſe: In a word, there are <hi>Viſa animi,</hi> as well as <hi>Viſa ſenſus;</hi> and ſome of them Connatural, ſome Preternatural; of the former, every one that is well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and well Grounded, is an Example; and for the latter, we have as many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as there are ungrounded and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſtinctions, and Notions; of which the Schoolmen afford us but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in their <hi>Subſtantial Forms,</hi> Inherent
<hi>Accidents,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:65808:46"/>Real Cogitables <hi>Reductive,</hi> are ſuch as come from Cauſes that are Cauſes only, and not Objects as well as Cauſes, of the Act of Cogitation, which immediately produces them: And theſe as well as thoſe that are proper, are either of the External
<hi>ſenſe,</hi> or of the <hi>Imagination,</hi> or of the

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of meer Cogitables, or Fictions. What a Fiction is. That all Fictions are Creatures either of the Mind, or of the Internal Senſe; None made by the External Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Reaſon of it. Two Philoſophical Doctrines obſerved, one concerning meer Cogitables, the other about Real Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles Reductive. Why the Repreſentations of things in Prophetical Dreams, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made as if they were preſent.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALL that I have ſaid already, relates to things that are in our Faculties, by virtue of impreſſions made upon them from External Cauſes, which Cauſes are either Cauſes and alſo Objects, or Cauſes only and not Objects; there are others that do ariſe in us from the working of our Faculties, (of themſelves,) without any grounds for it, in any thing that is external, either as a Cauſe, or as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and theſe I call
<hi>meer Cogitables,</hi> or <hi>Fictions;</hi> ſuch as an
<hi>Hirco-cervus,</hi> or a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> a Golden Mountain, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Fictions are all forged, either by the <hi>Mind</hi> and Underſtanding, or by the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65808:47"/>and internal Senſe; there are none in the external, the Eye, the Ear, or the like; and the <hi>Reaſon</hi> is evident, for Fictions are voluntary things, things that have always ſomething of the <hi>Will</hi> in them, and therefore cannot be created by any Faculty but That, which is under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Will, which the External Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are not, but the other Powers are: For though we may think, and alſo imagine, what we will, we cannot See, or Hear, or Taſte, or Smell, or Feel, what we will. The Reaſon of which difference may be this, that if the Underſtanding, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, were not ſome wiſe under the power of the Will, there could be no <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;</hi> and if the External Senſes were ſo ſo too, there could be no
<hi>certainty;</hi> and therefore that there may be both Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and certainty, our Faculties are ſo contrived, and ſo ordered, with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Here it muſt be obſerved,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) That there is <hi>ſome</hi> Reality even in
<hi>meer</hi> Cogitables, (not indeed the ſame that is in thoſe that are
<hi>real,</hi> which have a reality of Grounds and Foundations; but a reality) both in reſpect of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative <hi>Act,</hi> which doth produce them, and of that Cogitable and Objective <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,</hi> which they have in the Mind;<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65808:48"/>ſince it is as truly ſaid, that one does think, or conceive ſuch things, as it is of him that Dreams, or ſees a Viſion, that he does Dream, or ſee a Viſion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Cogitables as theſe, in reſpect of their Objective Exiſtence, may be referred to Realities of
<hi>Appearance,</hi> as Dreams and Viſions are; for as the Act of Dreaming Really <hi>is,</hi> and the thing Dreamt doth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>ſeem;</hi> ſo the Act that produces a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Really is, and the Fiction alſo really ſeems. However, meer Cogitables, and Real Cogitables Reductive, or more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, meer Fictions, and Dreams, and Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do not <hi>agree</hi> in all reſpects, even in point of Appearance; but as in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards there is an Agreement, ſo in others, there is a difference, between them, in this point; for if any is to be made (as doubtleſs ſome is) between Real ſeeming, and a ſeeming to be Real; there is this between the foreſaid Cogitables; that Dreams and Viſions do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Really ſeem, but ſeem to be Real; Whereas Fictions, do only really ſeem, but do not ſeem to be Real; at leaſt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and as Fictions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It muſt be alſo noted, that in the Real Cogitables which I call <hi>Reductive,</hi> though their Cauſes are not Objects, yet they do impreſs our Faculties the ſame<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65808:48"/>
                     <hi>way,</hi> and with the ſame kind of <hi>motions,</hi> that Objects uſe to do, and that <hi>ſuch</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as do ſeem to Appear would really have done, had they been indeed the Cauſes of theſe Images and Forms, that do Repreſent them, in ſuch Inſtances. Thus when we have the
<hi>ſound</hi> as of Bells in our Ears, and yet none are Ringing, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Air</hi> in them, though Agitated only by a Vapor, Affects the Auditory Nerve the ſame way it would have done, had the External Air been really Agitated by the Ringing of Bells, and the Internal moved by the External. Thus alſo a ſmart Percuſſion of the <hi>Eye,</hi> Affects its
<hi>Nervous</hi> parts the ſame way, and with the ſame kind of Motion, that a ſpark of Fire beheld by it would have done: And thus too in ordinary
<hi>Dreams,</hi> the Spirits of that part of the Brain (if indeed it be the Brain) that is the Organ of Imagination, are moved by the internal cauſes of ſuch Dreams, juſt in the ſame manner that they would have been, had they been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by Eternal Objects; which alſo muſt be ſaid of Angelical Dreams, and of Viſions.</p>
                  <p>And if our Faculties be moved by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſes that are not Objects, in the ſame manner as they be by external cauſes that are Objects, it can remain no longer<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65808:49"/>a Wonder, that the Images and Forms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in us by ſuch Impreſſions, ſhould ſeem as real, and as much external, as if they were excited by Objects, Since our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can make no difference. Hence it is, that in <hi>Angelical Dreams,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Viſions,</hi> all the Repreſentations which are made unto the Prophet, are as of things that <hi>Are</hi> in preſent, not of things that
<hi>Shall be,</hi> in Future; <hi>I ſaw a ſtone cut out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain without Hands,</hi> ſays <hi>Daniel;</hi> or if a declaration muſt be made of ſomewhat which is to come, that declaration is made by way of Diſcourſe, by a perſon preſent; ſo that ſtill the Dream or Viſion is <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and Hiſtorical; as in that of the Angel to
<hi>Joſeph, Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus.</hi> Many Divines have taken notice of this Appearance, in the <hi>Old Teſtament Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> having obſerved that theſe are always made in a <hi>Narrative</hi> Form, and as Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of things preſent; but the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which they give for it, which is, that it is done to ſignifie, that the things Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted ſhall as certainly come to paſs, as if they were already, ſeems not ſo well grounded as the Obſervation it ſelf; for I take it, the account that I have given is the more Genuine and Natural, which is, that External Cauſes that are not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do yet impreſs the Faculties which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65808:49"/>they Act upon, in the ſame manner that Objects do; and therefore all the Images that do Ariſe from ſuch Impreſſions, muſt be of things as preſent, and in being; becauſe they Repreſent them as if Really they were <hi>Objects in Act,</hi> that had excited and ſtirred the Faculties.</p>

                  <p>THing taken ſtrictly, as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends but Subſtances, Modes and Acccidents, is whatever ſeems <hi>External</hi> to any Faculty, and conſequently, ſeems to have Being in the World, as a Part, or an Appurtenance, of it, whither it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo or no. And in this ſenſe of the Word, as <hi>Real Things</hi> themſelves, (which are eminently called Things.) So likewiſe the <hi>Sentiments</hi> we have of theſe things, as Colours, Sounds Sapors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Things; and thus alſo,
<hi>Notions</hi> are<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65808:50"/>Things, both the more general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions, thoſe of Subſtance and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and the more ſpecial, the Notions of the ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> of Quality, and <hi>thoſe</hi> of Relations, <hi>&amp;c-</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when I ſay, that not only things themſelves, but the Sentiments and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have of them, are Things, it muſt be underſtood with <hi>diſtinction;</hi> for the Things themſelves, (ſo I call the
<hi>grounds</hi> of Sentiments and Notions) are Realities of <hi>True Exiſtence;</hi> but Sentiments and Notions being only Real Cogitables, are only <hi>ſeeming</hi> Realities; Realities of <hi>Apparition</hi> only, not of <hi>Exiſtence:</hi> Thus, the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Subſtance</hi> is a Reality of Appearance only, but the things that we apply it to, are Realities of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</p>
                  <p>By the Notion of thing as taken ſtrictly, we have a Riſe afforded us to apprehend the difference between the Notions the Underſtanding hath <hi>of</hi> things, and thoſe it hath only <hi>about</hi> things; for the Notions that I call the Notions of things, appear to the Underſtanding as
<hi>Things External</hi> unto it; for (not to mention Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) even ſome Relations, and Intelligible Qualities do ſeem to the Underſtanding, as really Inherent in the things they are Attributed to, as the ſentiments of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65808:50"/>Colours, Odors, and Sounds do unto the Senſes. But for Notions that are only framed by the Mind about Things, ſuch as Cauſe, Effect, Meaſure, Meaſured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſeem not to it to have being in the things themſelves, but to ariſe from its own Reflexions, upon comparing and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Things. Thus, at the ſame time that the mind conceives of Almighty God, that he is the Cauſe of all, as it does conceive, that the word [God] is the name of a Real Being, ſo it conceives alſo, than the term [Cauſe] is not, but that it only ſignifies a certain Kind of Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Things, as theſe do ſpring from him, and ſo is only the name of a certain Objective, and not of a Real, Being.</p>
                  <p>Of the things that do Appear unto our Faculties to have a Reality of being, <hi>ſome</hi> are perceived by them <hi>immediately,</hi> in their own proper Formal Natures, and thoſe are either <hi>Modes,</hi> or
<hi>Compleat Accidents; Others</hi> are not perceived by them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, in their own proper Formal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but only by <hi>means</hi> of, and under, thoſe that are perceived ſo; and <hi>theſe</hi> are called
<hi>Subſtances:</hi> Compleat Accidents and Modes are Appurtenances, Subſtances are the things to which they do Appertain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:65808:51"/>It is true, <hi>Spionoſa</hi> is in another perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; who tells us, that he underſtands by
<hi>Subſtance,</hi> that which is in it ſelf, and is conceived by it ſelf, that is, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, a thing in whoſe conception that of another is not involved. Adding, that by <hi>Attribute</hi> he underſtands the ſame that he means by Subſtance, to wit, a thing conceived in and by it ſelf, in whoſe conception that of another is not involved. Thus ſays he,
<hi>Extenſion,</hi> in as much as it is capable of being conceived in and by it ſelf, is an <hi>Attribute;</hi> but <hi>Motion</hi> that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived but as ſomething in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, is None. Only he ſays too, to prevent Objections; that a Notional diſtinction may be made between a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and an Attribute, in this manner, that a thing may be called an Attribute in reſpect of the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> which doth Attribute ſuch a certain Nature to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and then a Subſtance is the thing that the Underſtanding doth Attribute that Nature unto.</p>
                  <p>But as what this Philoſopher ſays on this occaſion is not very clear, ſo it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Notion of Subſtance, as alſo that of an Attribute, is Relative; nor are the Inſtances he puts ſo well adjuſted, but that ſome exceptions may be brought againſt them.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Primary Notion or Idea which we have of
<hi>Subſtance,</hi> is (as I have hinted in the former Chapter) that of a thing which is a <hi>Subject,</hi> or an <hi>Ultimate</hi> Object; that is, we have not any Real immediate Conception of it, but only a Notional. Or (to ſpeak more plainly,<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65808:52"/>according to the Principles laid before) Subſtance as ſuch, is not a thing conceived juſt as it is in its own Reality, but a thing conceived under a certain notion; that is, a ſubſtance is a thing that is a Subject. For when the Underſtanding does think of the things we call Accidents (which are the only things that do immediately, and at firſt preſent themſelves unto us,) for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when it thinks of Odours, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, ſapors, figures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it doth at the ſame time conceive, that beſides <hi>theſe</hi> there muſt be other things that have them, in which thoſe odors, colours, ſapors, figures,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are. And thoſe things that are conceived to <hi>have</hi> thers, we call <hi>ſubſtances;</hi> as thoſe that are conceived to be
<hi>had</hi> of others, or to be in them, we call <hi>Accidents:</hi> but what thoſe things, which we do Denominate Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Are, in themſelves, ſtript of all their Accidents, is no wiſe known; All we know of any ſubſtance is, that it is the ſubject of ſuch and ſuch Accidents; or that it is Qualified ſo or ſo; and hath theſe, and the other Qualities.</p>
                  <p>This Notion of a ſubſtance [that it is the ſame with a ſubject,] I call Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe though that [of ſubſiſting by it ſelf,] is deemed ſo by others, yet, in our ordinary way of Reaſoning, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigating of things, this [of ſelf-ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] is a conſequent one, to that of being <pb n="98" facs="tcp:65808:53"/>a ſubject. For converſing with things; as the firſt that do preſent themſelves to our conſideration, are the Accidents of them; ſo the firſt Reflection the underſtanding makes, upon theſe Accidents, is, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are under them, which do uphold and ſupport them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that are
<hi>ſubjects,</hi> or ſubſtances. But then indeed, when it comes again to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether theſe ſubjects are alſo <hi>in</hi> ſubjects, finding in its ſelf a certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance to conceive (that) they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if they were, there would be no end, things would be in one another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely; therefore it concludes, that that, which is a ſubject of Accidents, is it ſelf in no ſubject; that is, it is ſelf-ſubſiſtent. Thus the notion of being ſelf-ſubſiſtent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from that of being a ſubject: Nor is the notion of [being ſelf-ſubſiſtent] a more Real one, than that of [being a ſubject.] For what is Self-ſubſiſtence but an <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi> that belongs to ſomething elſe? but what that ſomething elſe is, to which it belongs, I am willing to learn; and will ever honour as my great Maſter, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who will effectually teach me. We have no Ideas of any ſubſtances, but ſuch as are Notional and Relative; that is, ſuch as do ariſe from them as they ſtand in our Analogy, and are cloathed with Accidents.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65808:53"/>A truth that might be made to appear by a full Induction of all the particulars; But will inſtance but in ſome; but thoſe the moſt obvious, and moſt commonly diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of. For what Idea have we of
<hi>Earth,</hi> but that it is ſomething material, that it is fixt and taſtleſs? What of <hi>Salt?</hi> but that of ſomething ſapid, and eaſily ſoluble in water? And what Idea have we of <hi>water?</hi> but that it is ſomething material, moiſt, and fluid in ſuch a degree, and the like? So that the Idea of a ſubſtance is that of a thing which is a ſubject; and this is a Relative Idea.</p>
                  <p>But many, who cannot ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the former, do conceit that they have found a Better, a Real, a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Idea of Subſtance. Of theſe, ſome do hold, <hi>Extenſion</hi> is that Idea, ſo that ſubſtance is Extenſion; and accordingly as Extenſion is either Penetrable, or Impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable, ſo they frame the Notions of
<hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> or the ſpecies of ſubſtance, as it is immaterial, or material. Others hold, that <hi>Exiſtence</hi> or Being is the Idea of ſubſtance in general, and that ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this or that particular ſpecies, are only determinate Talities of Being; for ſince in being is the Idea of an Accident, being (ſay they) muſt be that of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and as to be is to exiſt, ſo <hi>being</hi> is nothing but
<hi>exiſtence.</hi>

<hi>Beſides,</hi> it is not conceiveable, that a Spirit ſhould be only a Penetrable Extenſion, ſince (as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more fully hereafter) Extenſion has but little to do with mind or thought, which is Eſſential to a Spirit, and without which a Spirit cannot be a Spirit: and Penetrability, and Impenetrability has all as little.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the <hi>ſecond</hi> Opinion more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable. For not to Inſiſt, that Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence properly taken is only of Cauſates, (<hi>exiſtere</hi> properly being [<hi>eſſe extra cauſas,</hi>] and nothing properly is [<hi>extra cauſas</hi>] that was not firſt (<hi>in cauſis;</hi>) I will take it at large, for <hi>any</hi> being in act; yet even ſo, it is not of the Idea, or firſt Conception, of ſubſtance: for
[being] taken not as a <hi>Noun,</hi> but as a <hi>Participle,</hi> (as here it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,) is in the very ſenſe of the term, a word of Relation;
<hi>being</hi> is not a <hi>thing,</hi> but of a thing; not a thing, but a
<hi>mode</hi> of it,<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65808:54"/>and conſequently preſuppoſing it; and that which preſuppoſes thing or ſubſtance, cannot poſſibly be in the Idea, or firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it. In ſhort, Accidents have being, tho' not the ſame being as ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but to proceed.</p>
                  <p>Now, if this is the proper notion of ſubſtance in general, that it is a thing that is a ſubject of Accidents, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that we cannot frame any <hi>Notions</hi> of ſubſtances in particular, or make any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable <hi>Diſtributions</hi> of them, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeveral Accidents, of which they are ſubjects. And this I deſire may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe it will be of very great uſe in clearing what I ſhall ſay hereafter, in the proſecution of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Of Subſtances ſome are <hi>Principles,</hi> ſome
<hi>Principiates.</hi> By <hi>Principles,</hi> I mean ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that are cauſes of other things, but are themſelves uncauſed. By
<hi>Principiates,</hi> (give me leave to make an Engliſh word of one not very good Latin) I mean ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that are cauſed, or compoſed of Principles. Principles make, Principiates are made to be.</p>
                  <p>That there are ſubſtantial Cauſes, and ſubſtantial Effects, in the World, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſenſe; For even to ſenſe, ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances <hi>begin</hi> to be, and ſome do <hi>ceaſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now that which begins to be, is<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65808:55"/>made to be after having not been, muſt of neceſſity have Something, (and this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt of neceſſity be another thing,) that makes it to be; that is, it muſt have a
<hi>Cauſe.</hi> So that Cauſes and Effects there are; elſe nothing could begin to be, or ceaſe being. And if there are Cauſes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Cauſes, all of them have Cauſes alſo, and conſequently, as they (as Cauſes) make other things to be; ſo, (as things that have Cauſes) themſelves are made to be by others; or elſe, at leaſt ſome of them have no cauſes, but are ſelf-ſubſiſtent and uncauſed. If all Cauſes have Cauſes, then an infinite Progreſſion muſt be owned in the account of Cauſes, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more repugnant to the mind of Man; to Science; and to the Order and Unity of the Univerſe. And indeed then, there muſt be a number actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, ſince all Cauſes are actual. But if any Cauſes are uncauſed, (as certainly ſome muſt be, for the reaſons Alledged) thoſe uncauſed Cauſes are <hi>Principles,</hi> or firſt Cauſes. More ſhortly, either ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Univerſe of being is uncauſed, and ſo is a Principle, for what is uncau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is a Principle; or elſe, every thing is Cauſed; but every thing cannot be Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for if every thing is Cauſed, Nothing muſt be the cauſe of Something. For if<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65808:55"/>every thing is cauſed, every thing was once nothing, for what is Cauſed was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before it was Cauſed; and if every thing was once Nothing, either Nothing muſt be the Cauſe of ſome, or, (which in effect is the ſame) nothing may become ſomething without any cauſe, than which No thought can be more unreaſonable.</p>
                  <p>Again, as nothing is more certain than that there is ſome Principle, ſo the <hi>Stoicks</hi> (the Wiſeſt of all the Philoſophers, as well as the moſt Devout) affirmed, that there are <hi>two,</hi> Mind, and Matter. Thus <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Epiſtles (<hi>Ep.</hi> 65.)
<hi>Univerſa ex Materia &amp; ex Deo conſtant.</hi> All things (ſays he) are compoſed, or, do Conſiſt of God and Matter. And indeed, we cannot be more aſſured by all our faculties, that there is <hi>Action,</hi> and
<hi>Paſſion</hi> in the World, and that the World could neither be, or perſevere in being, without them, than we are to ſpeak Philoſophically, that there are <hi>two</hi> Principles, <hi>one,</hi> the Principle of all the Action; the <hi>other,</hi> the Principle of all the Paſſion is in it; the former the <hi>Active</hi> Principle, or firſt ſubject of Activity, the latter the <hi>Paſſive</hi> Principle, or firſt ſubject of Paſſivity; of which, I call the firſt, <hi>Mind,</hi> the ſecond,
<hi>Matter.</hi> This Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Zeno</hi> in <hi>Laertius</hi> fully agrees unto, when he tells us, that the Principles of<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65808:56"/>things are <hi>two,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Active, and the Paſſive; Nor doth the great Originiſt
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſay much leſs, when in his <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he writeth of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God that moved, and of the <hi>Abyſs</hi> and Waters upon which he moved; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, in all <hi>Animal Generations,</hi> in which there muſt be a <hi>Male</hi> and a <hi>Female,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, an Active and a Paſſive Principle, there is ſome (and this no very Dark or Obſcure) Adumbration of it.</p>
                  <p>Before I do proceed to a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conſideration of theſe Principles, I would have it be obſerved, that we ought to
<hi>Diſtinguiſh</hi> what is manifeſt, certain, and of undoubted truth concerning them, from that which is but doubtful and uncertain. Now it is certain, <hi>that</hi> there is ſuch a thing as we do call <hi>Matter;</hi> ſuch a thing as <hi>Mind,</hi> ſuch a thing as <hi>Motion;</hi> and
<hi>that</hi> Matter is alter'd, figured, textur'd, and infinite ways wrought upon &amp; moulded by means of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Again,</hi> it is certain
<hi>that</hi> all things have not Mind in equal proportions, but that ſome exert the acts of it in a higher way and degree, and ſome in more ways for kind than others do; and alſo certain, <hi>that</hi> the exerciſes of Acts of Mind in all the ways and all the degrees of them in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Animals, (for we are not ſo well acquainted with others,) do much depend
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65808:56"/>upon the Nature and Qualifications of their Organs; that is, upon Texture and Diſpoſition of matter. Theſe things we are as certain of, as that our ſelves be, and have a true uſe of our faculties. But if we advance farther, and to endeavour to Enter and Penetrate into the very <hi>nature</hi> of Matter, into <hi>that</hi> of Mind, and into the
<hi>Nature</hi> of Motion; here being forſaken and deſtitute of ſenſe to hunt for us, we are much at a loſs, and as unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in our ſearch an inquiry after them, as to their juſt Realities, as we are in that of things, which are wholly out of our view. It is hard to conceive juſt what
<hi>matter</hi> is in its own Poſitive Reality; alſo what <hi>Mind</hi> is, and even what <hi>Motion</hi> is, (as taken for a ſubordinate Principle.) Nor can it be Demonſtrated, that (as ſome will have it) there is only
<hi>one</hi> ſubſtance in the Univerſe, and that Matter and Mind are only ſeveral <hi>Modifications</hi> of that one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; nor be Demonſtrated, that <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (for this I think they mean by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,) is in its own Nature, a <hi>vital</hi> Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical thing; and that the diverſe <hi>Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Life,</hi> that are obſerved in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpecies of Animals, ariſe only from the ſeveral Modifications of Matter, and of that <hi>life of nature</hi> (as thoſe Philoſophers call it) which is Eſſential thereto, and is<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65808:57"/>the
<hi>root</hi> of thoſe Perceptive, Appetitive, and Motive Powers that do dreſs up being in all the Shapes and Forms in which it appears upon the Stage of the World. I will not build upon ſuch <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> which being unevident, muſt needs be doubtful and uncertain, if not falſe. A Philoſophy that ſhall be <hi>ſolid,</hi> and ſound, muſt have its Ground-work and Foundations firmly, laid; which none can have, but that which is bottomed, rais'd and built upon <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> I mean, upon the certain
<hi>Teſtimony</hi> of our faculties. And therefore ſince our
<hi>faculties</hi> do rather go upon <hi>Notions,</hi> than on Realities, and do plainly <hi>Diſtinguiſh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mind and Matter, and (as I will ſhow in the Progreſs of this Diſcourſe) do Contradiſtinguiſh them, I hold my ſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to treat of theſe diſtinctly, but ſtill in the
<hi>Real Notional</hi> way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mind</hi> then is Cogitative, thinking, or perceiving ſubſtance; or, Mind is the firſt ſubject of Cogitation. <hi>Matter</hi> is Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſpacious, ſubſtance; or, the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of dimenſive ſpacious Quantity. In other, but Equivalent terms; <hi>Mind</hi> is Active ſubſtance, <hi>Matter</hi> Paſſive ſubſtance. I affirm, that theſe latter Definitions are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to the former, becauſe, in effect, it is the ſame to ſay, that Mind is <hi>Active,</hi> as to ſay, it is <hi>Cogitative;</hi> and the ſame to<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65808:57"/>ſay, that Matter is <hi>Paſſive,</hi> as to ſay, it is <hi>Spatious</hi> Extenſive ſubſtance. Nor is Mind Cogitation, or matter extenſion, as
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> makes them; but the former is Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative, the latter Extenſive ſubſtance. We find a Reluctance in our minds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Cogitation is a ſubſtance, as alſo to conceive Extenſion as one; and yet we cannot conceive Mind and Matter but as ſubſtances.</p>
                  <p>The main Reaſon why I do <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> Subſtance into Mind and Matter, as into <hi>firſt</hi> Original kinds, is, becauſe (as I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before) Cogitation and Extenſion, that do Conſtitute their ſeveral Ideas, are of no Relation one to another, for what hath a Thought to do with a Cube, or a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle? or with Length, or Breadth, or Depth? Certainly Cogitation and Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are quite different Accidents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing in their Ideas, that is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to both; and therefore the firſt ſubject of the one, cannot be conceived the firſt ſubject of the other; their ſubjects muſt be ſubſtances of quite as different kinds as themſelves are, at leaſt to us; ſince all the diverſity we can conceive in ſubſtances, is and muſt be, taken from the accidents they have, theſe being the Characters by, and under which alone, we do perceive and know, and by conſequence, can only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:65808:58"/>I inſiſt herein the more, for that many think that <hi>Mind</hi> is only an Accident, and that taken for a ſubſtance, it is unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and a meer <hi>Chimera:</hi> ſo that, tho' Matter is acknowledged (by them) to be a ſubſtance, it will not be yielded, that Abſtract, ſeparate mind can be one. But thoſe that think it ſo, if they conſider'd, that men have no conception of ſubſtance, nor can have any of it, but as it is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Accidents, they would ſoon change their Opinion. For the Accident of <hi>Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> or of Activity, that Mind is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of, is as diſtinctly and clearly conceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as that of Extenſion, or of Paſſivity, which matter is the ſubject of. Nor is the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf that is the ſubject of Extenſion, or of Paſſivity; any more Conceiveable but by, and under <hi>this;</hi> that is, the ſubſtance of mind and matter are equally conceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and equally unconceiveable. They know no more what <hi>that</hi> is in it ſelf, that is extended, than what <hi>that</hi> is, that is Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative; and may be as ſure, that they do think, as they are, that they are ſpacious, ay, they cannot know that they are ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but by thinking. But of ſpatioſity or extenſion, (the Accident that conſtitutes matter,) I ſhall have occaſion to diſcourſe hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of quantity, I proceed now to diſcourſe of Mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:65808:58"/>The Idea I have given of Mind, that it is the Immediate ſubject, or (as others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would chuſe to ſay) the Immediate Principle, of Cogitation, Energy, or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, is much more eaſie to be conceived than that of <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> when he defines the human mind to be the Idea of a body, or thing, actually exiſting: for Mind, even the human, is not ſo properly ſaid to be an Idea, as to be the Principle, our Cauſe efficient, of Ideas; ſince all Ideas (even in common ſenſe) are conceived; and Mind is that, which conceives them. Thus it is in our Refracted, Inadequate, <hi>Real-Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> way of conceiving; and for an Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate and juſt one, as it is above our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo I do not find that
<hi>Spinoſa,</hi> or <hi>Mal. Branche</hi> after all their Ambitious Reſearches in that higher way, have edified the World thereby to any great Degree. This way of <hi>ſeeing</hi> all things <hi>in God,</hi> and in their own proper <hi>Realities,</hi> is a way much out of the way. Otherwiſe, when
<hi>they</hi> keep the lower way of ſenſe, many of their thoughts are ſurprizing, and excellent.</p>

                     </gap>, All Spirit, nothing but Spirit.

Anſwers, he is <hi>Mens univerſi,</hi> the mind of the the Univerſe; and being obliged, for the cleering of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſhow the difference between the nature of God, and that of Man, adds, Mind is only the Principal <hi>part</hi> of <hi>our</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the
<hi>whole</hi> of Gods, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65808:60"/>but Mind God is pure Mind, all Reaſon. In his own terms thus, <hi>Quid ergo intereſt inter naturam Dei &amp; noſtram? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri melior pars Animus eſt, in illo nulla pars extra animum.</hi> Again, in his Epiſtles (<hi>Ep.</hi> 65.) He has this expreſſion, <hi>Nos nunc primam &amp; Generalem cauſam quaerimus, haec ſimplex eſſe debet; nam &amp; materia ſimplex eſt;</hi> now, ſays he, we ſeek the firſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cauſe, which ought to be ſimple (or uncompounded) for even matter it it ſelf is ſimple. Only, I doubt, he (as many other Philoſophers did) took God but for an immanent an ingredient Cauſe of all; which perhaps is only true of the Moſaical Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>God</hi> as he is <hi>Pure</hi> mind, is an
<hi>Inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſible Light,</hi> that dazzels all the eyes that behold it; and therefore, we can hope to acquire but very little particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of
<hi>him</hi> or acquaintance with him, under this notion. But then again, as the <hi>Sun</hi> that cannot be beheld directly, in its own proper light, may yet be ſeen by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; ſo may the Deity, in an <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> and by way of Parable; by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him after the manner of men. The holy
<hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves go this way. They Repreſent God as an Infinite Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Perſon, (ſuppoſe a man,) that hath Underſtanding, Will, and Affections; that<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65808:60"/>conſults and decrees; and that is touched (as men are) with the motions of Love, Hatred, Deſire, Averſion; and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this Notion, do further Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him, ſometimes as a Father, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as a Lord, or as a great King, that Governs the Univerſe, according to the Rules and Laws that he himſelf hath ſet, and by rewards and puniſhments. Now, all this is <hi>Parabolical,</hi> and but Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Knowledge: However, we ought to ſatisfie and <hi>Content</hi> our ſelves therewith; for though it is not to know the Deity in in the Reality, as he is in himſelf, yet it ſuffices for the Principal
<hi>End</hi> for which we ſhould endeavour to know him; which is to Adore and Obey him. <hi>Beſides,</hi> it is well nigh the only particular Knowledge of him that we Mortals are capable of, in this Terreſtial State; and, <hi>in fine,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much, in effect, as that which we have of any thing elſe, even in the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real World.</p>
                  <p>It is true we underſtand that <hi>Matter</hi> and
<hi>Motion</hi> are Real things, and that all others that are Corporeal, do reſult from theſe; but this (at leaſt) is only a <hi>General Confuſed Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>no more</hi> than <hi>that</hi> we have of the Abſtracted Pure Mind. For, as to the <hi>particular</hi> Natures of things, their Internal Fabrick and Texture,<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65808:61"/>and that degree of Motion, that is in the particles which compoſe them, (of this) we have only a weak imperfect Conjecture, without certainty. All the particular Knowledge that we have of things by which we diſtinguiſh them one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both in reference to their Kinds, and to the Individuals of thoſe Kinds, and by which we reſolve their Operations, is of nothing (to ſpeak of) but of
<hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;</hi> and Accidents are nothing but (as I have touched before, and ſhall ſhew again more fully hereafter) the <hi>Sentiments</hi> we have of things; <hi>they</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo much as Grounds or proper Repreſentations of Grounds, but only certain <hi>Appearances,</hi> under which our ſeveral Senſes do dreſs up things, and ſo ſhow them unto us: and this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for <hi>uſe.</hi>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65808:62"/>Windows in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> where the Seat of God was; and the very <hi>Heathen,</hi> many of them, Adored him with
<hi>Silence,</hi> as one that was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable and Unconceiveable: Methinks, it is meer Enthuſiaſm, to talk of Seeing All Things in the <hi>Original,</hi> when we cannot ſo much as look upon <hi>it;</hi> God is Pure Mind, and Pure Mind is Pure Light, of too Tranſcendent Glory to be immediately beheld by us, but Blear-eyed, Weak-ſighted Mortals.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>two</hi> Opinions in reference to the Nature of God, that <hi>Differ</hi> from mine; both of which I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, that of <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> That he is <hi>all</hi> Subſtance, and that Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Beings (even formally taken) are but Participations of his; as being only ſo many ſeveral Modifications of the Divine Attributes. But this is a Notion (of the Deity) that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive, as for other Reaſons, ſo for this particularly, that it makes him to be the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> and to be Matter, as well as Mind; whereas, God is neither Matter, nor the World or Univerſe, but only Pure Mind; for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65808:62"/>the Great World has a Mind, that made, and Governs it, as well as the Little Even Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> has ſaid, <hi>He that thinks this World without a Mind, I ſhall think him without a Mind:</hi> And ſays

                  <p>For my own part, I much doubt that thoſe Philoſophers, who profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this Opinion, [that God is <hi>all</hi> Subſtance, or that he is the World,] do really believe he has no Being at all, but, only in Fiction of Mind, and by way of <hi>Proſopopaeia;</hi> and that as

                  <p>The unwary Expreſſion of ſome Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, and Theologizing Philoſophers, who Denominated God <hi>Nature Naturing,</hi> might give occaſion to this improper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of him, among the moderns; as might alſo that miſtaken <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Infinity</hi> (as an Attribute of God) that ſome have given, which ſeems to ſhock his
<hi>diſtinction</hi> and ſingularity of Being. For <hi>thence</hi> it is Argued, how can God, be Infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he be not all Beings? And it he be, how can he be One by himſelf? be a Singular Individual Being, diſtinct from all others? Theſe were the ſpeculations, that obliged <hi>Spinoſa</hi> to conceive of God, that he is the <hi>Ingredient,</hi> Immanent Cauſe of all Things; and the ſpeculations too, that tempt others, to other miſtakes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. But when I come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Notions of
<hi>Finite</hi> and <hi>Infinite,</hi> and to Repreſent in what Senſe the latter is truly Aſcribed to God, I hope to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that there is great
<hi>Miſtake</hi> in ſuch Speculations and Arguings, and to exempt the true received Notion of Infinity both from theſe, and from all the like intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Embarraſments and Difficulties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:65808:63"/>The <hi>Second</hi> Opinion, is that of Dr. <hi>More</hi> and his Followers, who do hold, that God is an Infinite
<hi>Extenſion;</hi> that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued indeed with all Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Power, but he is an Extenſion ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and of this they are ſo confident, that ſome require a belief thereof as of an Article as great as any in the Creed; an Article that is the Foundation of all Religion; both revealed and Natural. But as I believe, that no Man hath known the Father except the Son, and he to whom the Son hath revealed him, ſo, ſince among all the Revelations that the Son has pleaſed to make of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is none [that he is an Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion] I cannot admit his being ſo, to be a Notion ſo Eſſential unto all Religion, as they would make it; Eſpecially when I conſider, that it might as eaſily have been ſaid, that God is <hi>Extenſion,</hi> as, that he is a <hi>Spirit;</hi> and Chriſt hath ſaid the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but not the former. Beſides, I cannot underſtand how Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Power ſhould be ſaid of meer Extenſion, which is but ſpace; it ſeems to me a leſſer Incongruity (though even this is Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity enough) to ſay that God is <hi>Matter</hi> ſo indued, than that he is <hi>Space</hi> ſo indued; ſeeing, even in common ſenſe, there is more of Reality and Being in meer Matter,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65808:64"/>than there is in meer Extenſion or Space. But to urge this Argument more home. By <hi>Extenſion,</hi> (which the perſons who are in this Opinion do Attribute to God,) they muſt mean either <hi>meer</hi> Space, or elſe a <hi>thing</hi> that in the Idea of it is <hi>Spatious.</hi> If meer Space is intended; As this does no ways differ from <hi>inane</hi> or
<hi>vacuum,</hi> ſo one may think, it might as well be ſaid (which yet its hard to ſay) that God is an Infinite <hi>inane</hi> or <hi>vacuum,</hi> that is, in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Engliſh, an Infinite Nothing indued with Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power, as, that he is infinite Extenſion ſo indued. On the other ſide, if by Extenſion is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a <hi>thing that</hi> in the Idea and firſt Conception of it is Extenſive, that is, a thing that does eſſentially take up ſpace, ſo as that it cannot be conceived, but withal ſpace muſt be Imagined, as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenant of it; in this Senſe, I cannot ſee how it differs from <hi>Matter;</hi> and then to ſay, that God is Extenſion, is to ſay, that he is Matter; whereas, God is Pure
<hi>Mind,</hi> not <hi>Matter. In fine,</hi> as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that God is Mind, rather than Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo likewiſe it is certain, that in the Ideas that we frame of Mind, and of all the things that properly relate to it, ſuch as Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Thought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We never do once think of Extenſion or<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65808:64"/>Space: And if at any time we do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to apply Extenſion or Space unto Mind, or to any thing properly mental, there always ariſes a Repugnance in us, upon but the thoughts of it; an Inch, a Foot, a Yard of Underſtanding, or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is a <hi>Bull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know it is Argued from the <hi>Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of God, that he is Extended; and in truth it is very hard to imagine any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with things that are extended, but withal, there muſt be an Imagination of ſome Extenſion in the thing that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: but ſtill, this is but
<hi>Imagination,</hi> which is apt to impoſe upon us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be examined by Reaſon. And Reaſon tells us, that we cannot have a diſtinct and clear conception of the <hi>preſence</hi> of God, if we have not (as we have not) ſuch an one of his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> ſince the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is but a Mode of his Eſſence; and if we have no diſtinct and clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the preſence of God, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of his Omnipreſence, or the way how he is preſent with all his Creatures, where ever they are; I do not ſee with what Cogency or Force an Argument can be Deduced from it, in this buſineſs- In ſhort, ſince things are preſent one with another very <hi>differently,</hi> in proportion to their ſeveral Natures, it will follow, that<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65808:65"/>things
<hi>Mental,</hi> muſt be preſent with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in much another way than thoſe that are <hi>Material,</hi> and Conſequently that God who is pure Mind, muſt be preſent with Material Beings, much otherwiſe, than theſe themſelves are, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>To underſtand this Text with the more clearneſs, we muſt have Recourſe unto <hi>Geneſis,</hi> Ch. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 14,

<hi>So ſtill his WORD Runneth very ſwiftly:</hi> The Spirit of God doth ſtill Execute, as he did at firſt, all the Directions and Commands are given it; He Produces the Snow; the Hoar Froſt; and Ice; he maketh Cold; and Raiſeth Winds; and cauſes all the Alterations that are made in the Air, in the Earth, in a Word, in all the Elements, and in all above them.

                  <p>I Think I ſhall not ſtep much (if I do at all) out of my way to make Inquiry in this place into the <hi>Original</hi> and Riſe of Motion. By <hi>Motion</hi> now I mean not Actual Motion, or Motion as it is the (actual) Tranſlation of Bodies from place to place; which ſome define
[<hi>The Succeſſive Application of a Body in all it hath out wardly, unto the ſeveral parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which touch it immediately;</hi>] which is the moſt uſual Senſe of the word. But here I mean by it, that
<hi>Force,</hi> Energy, or Motive Vertue called in Latine <hi>Impetus,</hi> from which this Actual Tranſlation, or Succeſſive Application of Bodies does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately come. And my Enquiry now<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65808:69"/>ſhall be concerning the <hi>Original</hi> of This, not in <hi>particular</hi> as it is in this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Body, but the Riſe of <hi>Impetus</hi> or Motive Force in <hi>general,</hi> which having found, I will <hi>firſt</hi> remove an Objection, and <hi>then</hi> improve the Diſcovery, to ſhew <hi>how</hi> Matter comes from Mind, as well as how Motion doth from a Principle that is at reſt.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that there is ſome appearance (at firſt ſight) of cauſe to believe, that as <hi>mind</hi> is the firſt ſubject of Cogitation, and <hi>matter</hi> the firſt ſubject of Extenſion, ſo, ſince <hi>Energy</hi> or Force (the immediate Principle of Action and of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual motion) is neither Cogitation, nor Extenſion, that ſome <hi>third</hi> ſubſtance Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct both from mind and matter, ſhould be the firſt ſubject of <hi>it,</hi> and conſequently, that there ſhould, be <hi>three</hi> Principles, Mind, Matter, and the firſt Mover. And indeed it looks as if the Scripture <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> did countenance <hi>this;</hi> for there mention is made of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which wrought, as the firſt ſubject of motion; of the Abyſs of
<hi>Waters</hi> wrought upon, as the firſt Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Subject; and of the
<hi>word</hi> Reaſon, or Wiſdom which directed the Work. But on ſecond Conſideration, as it is clear, that all that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays in his
<hi>Geneſis,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spirit, and the Word, is not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65808:69"/>ſaid with deſign to intimate, that really the Spirit was only a meer ſenſleſs inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Force, or Energy, and that Wiſdom or the Word was another diſtinct Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that directed and guided it in all its Motions; but to ſhew, ſince we men (in our inadequate way of Conceiving) do diſtinguiſh <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that all the works of God were made in <hi>Both,</hi> but Both united in one
<hi>Demiurgical Mind,</hi> or (to uſe <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Expreſſion) on
<hi>Ratio fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens.</hi> Thus, <hi>Ratio faciens</hi> is the Idea or Notion of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Spirit, the true <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Naturans,</hi> that concurred to make the World, not in the manner that <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did, who, in the Moſaical Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Acted only as an External Efficient, but in the way that the <hi>Soul</hi> would do in a living Creature, if firſt by its Plaſtic vertue it ſhould form all the members of the Body of it, and afterwards, ſhould inform it, and act in it. And <hi>Gotta</hi> in
<hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> has as finely as compendiouſly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Difference between theſe <hi>two</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways of working, even in Reference to the World. When <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>de Nat. Deor.</hi> he ſays, <hi>Ita prorſus exiſtimarem, ſi illum</hi> [<hi>mundum</hi>] <hi>aedificatum, non quemadmodum docebo, à naturâ conformatum putarem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is this Spirit that is the <hi>Original Cauſe</hi> of the
<hi>Impetus,</hi> that is the <hi>neareſt cauſe</hi> of<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65808:70"/>Local Motion; and indeed, it is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Cauſe of all
<hi>Mundane Activity</hi> and Energy: Motion comes from Energy or Action, and all Energy and Action from the Moſaical Spirit; [not from meer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but from mind in matter.] In ſhort, <hi>Impetus</hi> or Force ariſes from the
<hi>ſame</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that Cogitation or Perception does; as is evident by the following Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The <hi>firſt mention</hi> that we have of
<hi>motion,</hi> or Corporeal Action, is in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Moſaical Spirit, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. where it is ſaid, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God
<hi>moved</hi> upon the face of the waters. It is true, the word uſed in this Text for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ſeldom uſed, [but thrice in the whole Scripture, to wit, in this place, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.11. and in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.9.] And therefore the direct particular meaning of it will not be eaſily agreed, but that it imports ſome motion (which is as much as I do urge it for,) is beyond diſpute: <hi>Motum aliquem Notari,</hi> (ſays Hotting. in Exam. Hiſt. Creat. Queſt. 33.) <hi>non eſt Dubitandum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is farther Evident from the very <hi>Ideas</hi> that we have of things: For we cannot conceive mind as a Perceptive
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65808:70"/>Cogitative ſubſtance, but withall, we muſt conceive it as <hi>Active,</hi> and that there is ſomething <hi>Energetical</hi> in it; whereas, on the other hand, matter may (and in its own proper Idea muſt) be conceived as a thing that is only <hi>Paſſive,</hi> not Active; there being nothing of Active or Energe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical in it as it is but ſpacious extenſive ſubſtance; and therefore Energy and Action cannot be conceived to proceed but from matter, which in its ſelf is Idle and unactive; but rather from mind, which is eſſentially active and buſie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It may alſo be argued from the <hi>relation,</hi> that (Experience aſſures us,) is between Cogitation and Actual motion. For we clearly perceive, that all our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motions do ariſe from Thought or Imagination; we do move our ſelves, or any particular part that hath the proper inſtruments of voluntary motion, and theſe duly qualified, at our pleaſure, when we will; that is, by imagination and thought. We go, we ſtand ſtill (which is by Tonic motion;) we put our hands, feet, heads, eyes, and other parts of our bodies into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and regulate them in their ſeveral motions, by will or thought, ay, even co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation it ſelf in all the ſeveral modes of it, as it is ſenſation, imagination, or rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination,<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65808:71"/>does ever bear a proportion to ſome motion; inſomuch that as the minute parts of any Organ that ſerves unto Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any kind, are more or leſs in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, (which is meant and is Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,) as the <hi>Organ</hi> is in more or leſs Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Aptitude to receive impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo anſwerably, the Act of Cogitation is graduated. Organs that are affected with heavineſs or
<hi>torpor,</hi> (as thoſe are whoſe Particles are too little in motion, and conſequently indiſpoſed for receiving fitting impreſſions,) are anſwerably under a <hi>Stupor,</hi> or Diminution of ſenſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: but inflamed Organs, whoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles have too much motion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are apt to be too <hi>eaſily,</hi> or too <hi>much</hi> ſtirred, theſe are exquiſitely ſenſible and tender. In fine,
<hi>Reaſon</hi> it ſelf, as to its grounds, is but <hi>Harmony;</hi> a certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification and turning of the parts, (either the Spirits, or the Filaments,) that are the immediate inſtruments of that kind of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation; ſo that they be not wound up too high, or let down too low; that is, that they be not in too much motion, or aptitude unto it, or in too little, but in a juſt mediocrity; and this is to be in <hi>Tune,</hi> or in Harmony. The truth hereof is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For if the Organ of Reaſon is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo that the Particles of it are too<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65808:71"/>much in motion, the action that it exerts in that inſtance is not reaſon, but <hi>madneſs</hi> of one ſort or another; and again, if the Organ is torpid, through a defect of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Particles of it, the Cogitation that is exerciſed in this inſtance is plain <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity</hi> and folly; and the power a dulneſs or ſhortneſs of wit. Wherefore <hi>Ariſtoxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Muſician, who affirmed that the Soul was a Harmony, as he receded not from his Art, ſo he did not much wander from the true nature of the Soul. In truth,
<hi>Harmony</hi> or Proportion is the <hi>Soul of the World.</hi> For if we look well, we ſhall find that, that which formalizes things, and qualities, and which makes them be of this or that kind, and to act in this or that way, is nothing but the Proportion or <hi>Logos</hi> that is in them; that is, it is the <hi>Tuning</hi> of them in the world, and one to another, as to parts, and motions: moſt, if not all the <hi>Specifical Qualities</hi> and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the World, ariſe from hence; which are therefore called
<hi>Occult,</hi> becauſe this Spring and Original of them is ſo little regarded; but of this more in another, and perhaps a more proper place,</p>
                  <p>But to more illuſtrate the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſhow in a fuller light, the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65808:72"/>between Cogitation and actual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I will enter farther into the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>motion;</hi> and will manifeſt, both the <hi>ſubtlety</hi> of it, and alſo the
<hi>Correſpondence</hi> which it holds with Mind, or the
<hi>Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> I will not ſpeak now of the motion that is
<hi>Local</hi> to ſuch a Degree, that it falls under <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the ſenſe, but of <hi>that</hi> motion (for motion it is) that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the <hi>being</hi> of ſenſe; which for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſake may be called <hi>Impreſſion.</hi> We are convinced by ſenſe, that in the <hi>Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> that make it, there is a great deal of ſubtlety, and this too in various <hi>Degrees;</hi> and we are equally convinced, that there are various ſenſitive <hi>Powers</hi> to receive
<hi>them,</hi> in thoſe ſeveral Degrees. Thus the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion made upon the <hi>Eye,</hi> that cauſes <hi>Viſion,</hi> is by many Degrees more delicate and fine than that which cauſes the <hi>Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> ſince the Object ſeen by the Eye, and Conſequently making a Viſive impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (upon it) ordinarily doth not make any upon the ſenſe of feeling. I ſay ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, becauſe ſometimes, where the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the viſible is very ſtrong, as when one looks upon the Sun, or on ſome other very ſtrong and vigorous Light, the <hi>feeling</hi> of the <hi>Eye</hi> is affected, as well as the <hi>Sight,</hi> ſo that there is a ſenſe of
<hi>pain,</hi> from a ſolution of Continuity. Which plainly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65808:72"/>evinces (to note it by the by) that all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible impreſſion, tho' it be not ſenſibly a motion, yet really is ſo, ſince even viſible impreſſions, if ſtrong and vigorous, are painful; and conſequently, are motions; for nothing cauſes pain but motion; pain being nothing but little Spaſms and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the parts; and if ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be motions, weaker ones are ſo too; tho' in a leſs degree.</p>
                  <p>Again, The impreſſion made upon the <hi>Ear,</hi> that cauſes <hi>ſound,</hi> tho' it be by much a leſs fine and delicate one than that upon the Eye, which cauſes Light or Colour, it is however of far greater fineneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy than that Impreſſion which produces
<hi>pain</hi> in the Ear; For as we <hi>ſee</hi> without pain, ſo, ordinarily we <hi>hear</hi> without it; that is, we are affected by ſonorous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which do propagate their motions to our ears, with the ſentiment of ſound, without being ſenſible of this Affection any other way. And yet if the ſound be too intenſe, it always <hi>pains,</hi> and often breaks, or too much ſtretches the <hi>Timpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> or Drum of the Ear. The obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſome Philoſophers have taken of this latter effect, occaſion'd them to make a <hi>Maxim,</hi> that <hi>an Excellent Object deſtroys the Senſe;</hi> but poſſibly this muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with Correction, not ſo much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65808:73"/>of the Faculty or Perceptive <hi>Power,</hi> as of the <hi>Organ;</hi> for could the Organ bear thoſe ſtronger impreſſions, without Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Hurt, the perceptive Faculty would not be offended, it is not the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either that of
<hi>Light,</hi> or that of <hi>Sound,</hi> that offends, but the motion that cauſes <hi>it,</hi> which is too ſtrong for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and diſſolves or alters its Texture. In fine, the impreſſion that cauſes
<hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> is by much a finer and more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one, than that which cauſes ſenſation, whether External, or Internal; and that by as many degrees as <hi>Intellectual Ideas</hi> are more fine and ſubtle than
<hi>Images,</hi> and the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> a finer and more delicate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty than the <hi>Senſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Finer</hi> and Delicater <hi>Impreſſions,</hi> I mean ſuch as have leſs of Local Motion. By Finer and Delicater
<hi>Faculties,</hi> I mean ſuch as are ſenſible of Finer and Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Touches, or Impreſſions.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe, the <hi>Imagination</hi> muſt needs be a finer and more delicate faculty than any external ſenſe, for as much as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the impreſſions of External Objects but by <hi>Reflection,</hi> or Communication from the <hi>Senſories,</hi> but theſe have them
<hi>directly</hi> from the very <hi>Objects</hi> themſelves; and by the ſame Reaſon, the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> that receives impreſſions from the <hi>internal ſenſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:65808:73"/>muſt needs be (as indeed it is) a much finer and delicater faculty than <hi>That.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, it is evident, that there is a near relation between actual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cogitation, and conſequently, that it is no unreaſonable thought to think, that as they are <hi>near of kin,</hi> ſo both are Off-ſprings of <hi>one</hi> Original cauſe, [mind in matter;] but then it will follow alſo, that motion, and indeed all Energy whatever in the Spring and Principle of it is <hi>Reſt,</hi> for ſo mind is. But this is the difficulty. For that motion ſhould come from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that is at reſt, appears as unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, as that Froſt ſhould come from Fire, or Darkneſs from Light.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to make this clear, I muſt conſider things in the <hi>Metaphyſical Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> as all are underſtood to come from one, by way of <hi>Emanation:</hi> and thus, all <hi>Created Being</hi> is compared to <hi>Light,</hi> that flows from the Sun; and then its
<hi>Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is in the ſame manner, as the <hi>Radiation</hi> of Light, which is from a Center into an Orb or Sphere, in <hi>Extenuating</hi> Lines. Now in this Hypotheſis, as all Beings (even thoſe that are moſt oppoſite) do come from <hi>one,</hi> ſo they come from <hi>it</hi> in this way, that the more <hi>Removed</hi> any is from the <hi>Central</hi> Being, the more <hi>Extenuated</hi> it is; that is, as <hi>God</hi> or pure mind is the Central Being,<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65808:74"/>that <hi>Sun,</hi> that is the Father of Lights; ſo all the Being that proceeds from <hi>him,</hi> has leſs of Light and more of Darkneſs, in proportion to the diſtance it has, upon the Scale of Being, and in its utmoſt <hi>Elonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or Removal from him, terminates in that, which in Appearance has nothing of Reſemblance to the Original Light; but (to be compared with it) is only <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and ſhadow; and this laſt is the Idea of <hi>meer matter,</hi> as that of the Central Light is of pure Mind. God is Light; Matter is <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> all intermediate Beings are <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> in ſeveral propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid is ſenſibly ſet out in the
<hi>ſhades</hi> of Colours, and in <hi>Colours</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which are but ſhades of <hi>Light;</hi> For the Extremes of <hi>any</hi> Colour, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the <hi>Brighteſt</hi> Red, and the <hi>Darkeſt;</hi> or the Extreams of <hi>all</hi> Colours, as <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Black;</hi> compare them each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they are ſo contrary, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more, eſpecially the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and yet they do participate, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer not only of Colour in general, but alſo of Red; and the latter, tho' of no particular Colour, yet of Light, which is the Ground of Colour in general; and alſo the Darkeſt Red, if it doth not come from the Brighteſt; and the Blackeſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65808:74"/>from the Whiteſt; yet, by the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Shades, or Participle, interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Colours, they are ſo continued one to another, that the Aſcent and Deſcent from one unto the other is moſt Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Delightful, as made by eaſie ſteps, without any Patches, or Chaſms. It is true, if we look on Contraries in their <hi>Phyſical</hi> Conſideration, ſo they are of <hi>oppoſite Natures,</hi> oppoſite Operations, and one expels the other, when they are immediately ſet together; but if we look upon them in their <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo they are but <hi>degrees</hi> of the ſame nature, and capable of being United and Reconciled; inſomuch, that One in a right ſenſe may be ſaid to come from Another; as Darkneſs from Light. For however contrary
<hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> are, each unto other, as to Qualities and Phyſical Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo in their Phyſical Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet as to their Metaphyſical, they differ but in <hi>degrees;</hi> both have the ſame grounds; for Shadow really is but leſſer Light, occaſion'd by the interpoſition of an Opaque Body, and Darkneſs is but a great Shadow. And thus a <hi>Flat</hi> and a <hi>Sharp,</hi> tho' contrary ſounds, as to their
<hi>Phyſical</hi> Conſideration, yet as to their <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical,</hi> they are but different degrees; the Sharp a greater, the Flat a leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65808:75"/>of Celerity. And thus as Darkneſs comes from Light, only by the Leſsning or Extenuating of it; ſo may matter come from mind: <hi>mind</hi> is pure Light, or, all Being in Eminence; but
<hi>matter,</hi> as it doth Participate nothing at all of mind, but only by meer Exiſtence, ſo it is meer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without the leaſt degree of Vitality or Life; and <hi>all Beings</hi> between Mind and Matter, are as
<hi>Colours,</hi> in reſpect of Light, or as <hi>Shades,</hi> in reſpect of any particular Colour.</p>
                  <p>But to add ſome further cleering to this Subject, and to ſhew how actual local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may come from a Principle that is at reſt, which being ſhewed, will ſhew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>how</hi> Matter may come from mind, ſince there is no greater Repugnance (even to common ſenſe) in the one, than is in the other, I will conſider the Relation that the
<hi>Center</hi> of a Circle has unto its <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> and how things are in the <hi>one,</hi> and how in the <hi>other;</hi> For this will afford it much Illuſtration. In the <hi>Center</hi> then of a Circle, or of a moved Sphere, all is at Reſt, and out of <hi>it</hi> all in motion, but in ſuch proportion, that that portion of a <hi>Radius</hi> which is at a farther diſtance from the Center, is <hi>more</hi> in motion, by reaſon of that diſtance, and that which is nearer<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65808:75"/>is <hi>leſs;</hi> which is evident even to ſenſe, in the following Diagram.</p>
                  <p>In the three Concentrical Circles, <hi>B. C. D. E. F. G.</hi> if the Ray <hi>A. B. D. F.</hi> is ſuppoſed to be moved from <hi>F.</hi> to
<hi>G.</hi> it will appear to any that conſiders, that in the ſame time that in the inmoſt Circle it doth move from <hi>B.</hi> to <hi>C.</hi> and in the middle from <hi>D.</hi> to <hi>E</hi> it moves in the outmoſt from
<hi>F.</hi> to <hi>G.</hi> that is, it moves faſter, and is more in motion, the farther it is from the Center <hi>A.</hi> and only becauſe it is ſo. Again, on the Contrary, in the ſame time that the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> moves in the outmoſt Circle from <hi>F.</hi> to <hi>G.</hi> it moves in the middle but from <hi>D.</hi> to <hi>E.</hi> and in the inmoſt (which is neareſt to the Center <hi>A.</hi>) but from <hi>B.</hi> to <hi>C.</hi> that is, it has more of Reſt, and leſs of Motion, the nearer it is to the Center, and in the Center has no motion at all, but is at pure reſt. Even ſenſe acquaints us, that the Arch or Space <hi>F. G.</hi> is much Greater than the Space <hi>D. E.</hi> and that <hi>D. E.</hi> is Greater than <hi>B. C.</hi> and ſo on the contrary, that the Arch or Space <hi>B. C.</hi> is leſs by much than <hi>D. E.</hi> and <hi>D. E.</hi> (by much) than the Arch or Space. <hi>F. G.</hi> and yet all the Spaces are ſuppoſed to be paſſed by the Ray <hi>A. B. D. F.</hi> in the ſame<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65808:76"/>time. Now that which paſſes a greater ſpace in the ſame time, is more in motion, and has greater Celerity; and that which paſſes a leſs, is leſs in motion, and has leſs of Celerity; and therefore ſince the nearer the Ray is unto the Center, the leſs ſpace it paſſes in the ſame time, and the farther off it is, the more it paſſes, and that more or leſs as it is farther off, or nearer, it evidently follows, that farther off from the Center, a Ray has more of motion, and as it is nearer to it, it has leſs, and in the Center has none.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>Well then, ſuppoſing that the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Energy and Motion is in the <hi>Center</hi> of the Orb of Being, (and we may well ſuppoſe it, ſince even <hi>Nature</hi> has its Sphere of Activity, and Acts as from a Center to a Circumference; (ſo <hi>Seeds</hi> Act, ſo
<hi>Light</hi> Acts and Diffuſes it ſelf;) it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that motion muſt come from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not in Motion, but at Reſt; for ſo that is, which is in the Center; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, elſe there muſt be infinite progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Motions. <hi>Again,</hi> ſince in the Orb of being, Pure Mind is in the Center,<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65808:77"/>and matter in the utmoſt Circumference, it follows, that the nearer things are unto pure mind, and the more they do partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of that, the more they have of Reſt, and the leſs of motion; but the farther off they are from pure Mind, and the nearer to matter, the more in motion they are. And indeed, all Energy in matter is Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Motion. Thus all the Effects of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm,</hi> as they are purely material, ſo they are performed <hi>only</hi> by Local Motion; but the buſineſs of Cogitation, even in the loweſt ſtep of it, which is ſenſation, as it is of nearer Relation unto mind than to matter, ſo it is performed rather by way of mutation, than of Local motion; the <hi>Eye</hi> is not ſenſible of any motion; imparted to it, nor is the Ear, or the Noſe, or any other of our Senſories, and yet each is ſenſible of a mutation made therein, (or rather in the Faculty) which comes from motion. But tho' the more refined any Beings are, and the nearer that they are to the Central Mind, the more at reſt they be, and the leſs in motion in their ſeveral Actions; and conſequently Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract Spirits that do not live in groſs Elementary Bodies, are more at reſt, and have leſs of motion, in the exerciſes of their ſeveral Powers, than Men have, who are imbodied in Elementary Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65808:77"/>yet <hi>no Spirit</hi> whatſoever but only <hi>God</hi> himſelf, who only is Pure Mind, is <hi>ſo</hi> wholly, ſo Abſolutely at Reſt, <hi>as</hi> that it ſees all Things at once, by one Entire view and Intuition; all Principles and all Concluſions in them; all Ends and all Means and Motives to them; without the leaſt degree of Succeſſion, or any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Only the <hi>Central Being</hi> ſees
<hi>ſo,</hi> and he doe's.</p>
                  <p>For ſeeing all the Circumference is in the Center, ſo that all the Lines how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever divided they be in the former, do meet together in the latter; it is plain, that an Eye placed in the <hi>Center,</hi> muſt needs ſee all in the <hi>Circle,</hi> as clearly as any thing in it; and this too with one Individual, ſingle Intuition, without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or, Addition; ſeeing there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Motion, but all is Reſt in the Center.

<hi>Time</hi> is Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, <hi>Eternity</hi> a Permanent Duration; together with a Conceit, that <hi>all Spirits</hi> (they being things Abſtract and Separate from Bodies,) both Are, and Act, <hi>in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi> as all Imbodied Beings Are, and do Act, in <hi>Time.</hi> Certainly every Being but God, is in Time, tho' not in the ſame Kind of Time; for as God only is in

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of Mind as it Actuates a certain Particular Body; Mind in this Notion called a Soul. Body is a Syſtem of Organs. Soul and Body an Animal. Body Conſidered two ways. To wit, in Reference to Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Objects,</hi> and in Reference to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Principle</hi> that Acts it. In the Firſt Conſideration of Body, the Ends and uſes of Organs are ſhewed, and withal the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their variety. This Illuſtrated by ſeveral Inſtances and Obſervations. The uſe of Body in Relation to the Internal Principle that Actuates it, is to Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and Singularize that Principle. This ſet out in ſenſible and plain Reſemblances. A Compariſon between Vital and Locomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Energy; with a Recapitulation of the whole Diſcourſe, as it unfolds the Myſtery of Animals.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have Conſidered Mind in the firſt Step of Relation that it carries unto Matter, Namely, as it doe's <hi>Actuate a moſt ſubtle Matter diffuſed throughout the Univerſe,</hi> in which Notion it is called
<hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> ſimply, as was ſhowed from <hi>Malachy, Ch.</hi> 2.
<hi>v.</hi> 15. Come we now to Conſider<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65808:79"/>it in the next place, as it <hi>Actuates ſome Particular System of Matter,</hi> in a Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Manner; and ſo it is called a <hi>Soul;</hi> and that Particular Syſtem of Matter, which it doth Actuate, is a <hi>Body,</hi> or a Particular Vehicle; and the Reſult of both an <hi>Animal.</hi> An <hi>Animal</hi> is nothing but Soul and Body together; or a Body Actuated by a Soul. A
<hi>Body</hi> is a Syſtem of Organs; an <hi>Organ</hi> is Matter framed and Contrived after a Particular Manner for ſome Animal Uſe, and End; ſome Uſe, End, or Action of a Soul: A <hi>Soul</hi> is a certain Determinate Vital Energy; or a certain Portion of the Spirit of the Univerſe, Veſted in a Body, or particular Vehicle; in which Notion all <hi>Souls</hi> are
<hi>Spirits;</hi> as indeed they are ſtiled in the Holy Scripture, wherein we Read of the Spirit of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> tho' it goes Downward, as well as of the Spirit of a <hi>Man</hi> that goes Upward.</p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe I fear will ſeem a little Myſterious; and therefore to Inlighten it, and withal to open (tho' but in general) the Myſtery of the <hi>Animal Nature,</hi> and, by Analogy unto it, the Nature of
<hi>other Vivents,</hi> I will Reſume it from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and ſpeak more Diſtinctly: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my Riſe from <hi>Bodies,</hi> or Syſtems of Organs, which coming under Senſe, are<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65808:79"/>better known unto us than Spirits or Souls.</p>
                  <p>Body then, as it is a Syſtem of Organs, has a
<hi>Double</hi> Relation, and ſo may be Conſidered two ways; either with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to External <hi>Objects</hi> by which it ſelf is Affected, and by means thereof, the Mind; or elſe with Reſpect to the Internal
<hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> that doth Inform and Actuate it, and Act in it, which Principle it doth <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduate</hi> and Singularize.</p>
                  <p>We will firſt Conſider a Body in the Relation that it has unto <hi>External Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> and here we muſt ſet out the
<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that is, the Ends and Uſes of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans which compoſe a Body, as alſo the Reaſon of the <hi>Variety,</hi> and number of thoſe Organs; why <hi>any</hi> Organs at all, and why <hi>many:</hi> both which will be done with one Performance. An Organ properly, is Matter Particularly Textured, and Framed for ſome Particular uſe: And an Animal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan is Particularly Textured, and Framed for an Animal uſe: I will give the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in only Senſitive Animals, and in the Acts of Senſation, as being beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; but what is ſaid of Senſation, and of the Organs of it, will, by Proportion, hold in all the other Actions of Animals, and in all other Organs, with a due Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:65808:80"/>In all <hi>Acts of Senſation</hi> there is firſt an <hi>Affection</hi> of the Organ, and then a <hi>Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that Affection by the Soul; or rather, a Perception Excited in the
<hi>Soul</hi> by means of that Affection; and this is the <hi>End</hi> of the
<hi>Organ,</hi> and the only Uſe of it, that the Soul makes, to wit, to come by means thereof unto a Perception of External Objects; as, to ſee their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to hear their Sounds, to Reliſh the ſeveral Taſts they have, and the like. In ſhort, a Soul cannot but by the <hi>means</hi> of
<hi>Organs,</hi> take any notice of External Objects, nor the Organ be a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying any notice to the Soul, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt <hi>Affected</hi> it ſelf. Now the <hi>Affection</hi> of the Organ ariſes from a
<hi>Perception</hi> (may I ſo expreſs it) or a Reception of the
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> Communicated to it by Objects; and a <hi>Capacity</hi> for this Reception from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Frame</hi> of the Organ. For ſince all Matter indifferently is not capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all kinds of Motions and Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but that for ſome <hi>Particular Motions</hi> and Impreſſions (of which ſort are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones) there muſt be
<hi>Particular Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and Frames of Matter to <hi>Catch</hi> them; it follows, that there muſt be <hi>Organs;</hi> and theſe too in ſuch
<hi>Variety</hi> and Number: there muſt be <hi>Organs,</hi> to Receive the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Motions of Objects, which<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65808:80"/>without a Particular Texture of Matter could not be Received; and there muſt be
<hi>Variety</hi> of Organs, to Correſpond theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kinds of Motions and Impreſſions that are in Coloured, in Sonorous, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and in other
<hi>Species</hi> of Objects.</p>
                  <p>This will be better conceived in ſome Inſtances, by which it ſhall be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that for the Reception of certain Particular Motions, there muſt be certain <hi>Particular Textures,</hi> and Diſpoſitions of Matter; ſo that Matter in ſome certain Frames and Diſpoſitions of it will <hi>Catch,</hi> and be Affected with, ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Particular Motions, that in others, it will not be <hi>Touched</hi> with. It is Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Obſerved, that an <hi>Uniſon</hi> ſtring will Receive the Motion, and ſo, Tremble, when another alſo Uniſon is made to Sound, and yet all other Strings of the ſame Inſtrument, that are not Uniſons, ſhall remain inſenſible and unmov'd. <hi>Cardan</hi> Obſerved, that in a certain Church, in which were ſeveral Images of Wax, but one would move and Tremble, and one always would, at the Ringing of a Sacring Bell. Mr. <hi>Boile</hi> has taken notice of the like Mechanical Perception, in ſeveral Empty Drinking-Glaſſes of Fine white Metal; he ſays, that cauſing the Strings of a Muſical Inſtrument to be variouſly<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65808:81"/>ſcrewed up, and let down, and briskly ſtruck, he obſerved, that the Motion of one String, when it was ſtretched to a certain <hi>Note,</hi> or Tone, would make one of the Glaſſes Ring, and not the other; nor would the ſound of the ſame String Tuned to another Note, ſenſibly Affect the ſame Glaſs; tho' perhaps, ſays he, it might have its Operation upon another. In fine, there are <hi>Yonical Echo's,</hi> that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn not the Voice but when it has ſome Peculiar Muſical Note, and then it doe's. Thus Organs are Matter Particularly Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, to the End to make them capable of Receiving ſome Particular Motions: ſo that a
<hi>Senſitive Organ</hi> may be Defined, a Syſtem of Matter Particularly Framed, Diſpoſed, and Textured for receiving ſome Particular Motion of External Bodies, and for Conveying it to the Soul.</p>
                  <p>So much concerning Body in its Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to External
<hi>Objects;</hi> come I now to conſider it in the Relation which it has to the <hi>Soul,</hi> (the Internal Principle that Actuates it, and Acts in, and by it; and ſo, the Great work and Buſineſs of the Body is to
<hi>Singularize</hi> and Individuate the <hi>General Vital Principle</hi> of the Univerſe, that it may become a <hi>Soul,</hi> or a Particular Vital Principle of a certain Particular Body. To underſtand this it muſt be
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65808:81"/>Conſider'd, that the <hi>Moſaical Spirit</hi> (the Riſe and Principle of all Created Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) as it is Extended throughout the whole Univerſe; ſo, to become in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular a <hi>Soul,</hi> of any Particular <hi>Animal,</hi> it muſt be <hi>Singularized,</hi> and Individuated, that is, it muſt be <hi>Apportioned</hi> (as it were) to that Particular Animal, which it comes <hi>to be</hi> by means of the Body. To Illuſtrate this, it muſt be Remembred, that a <hi>Voice</hi> or Sound Diffuſed throughout the whole capacity of the <hi>Medium</hi> (as the
<hi>Moſaical</hi> Spirit is throughout that of the univerſe) is yet in the
<hi>Phonocamptick Center</hi> or object (which is nothing but a place conveniently Diſpoſed for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,) <hi>ſo Individuated</hi> and Singularized (as the Moſaical Spirit is ſuppoſed to be by a Congruous fit Body,) that Really it has <hi>other Affections</hi> and Properties, than
<hi>thoſe</hi> it owns, in all the reſt of the <hi>Medium,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that by Vertue of it, this <hi>place</hi> inſtead of being a <hi>Medium</hi> of Sound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes to all Appearance a <hi>Principle</hi> of it, and ſo a
<hi>Speaker,</hi> and this is called an <hi>Echo.</hi> It may alſo be ſet out in a <hi>Speculum</hi> or Looking-Glaſs, (for a Body is to the Moſaical Spirit, what a <hi>Speculum</hi> or Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs is to the Image of an Object in the <hi>Medium;</hi>) A <hi>Speculum</hi> Catches the Diffuſed Image, and <hi>ſo Singularizes</hi> it, that<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65808:82"/>it becomes a very Different thing, and puts on other very Different Properties than thoſe it has in the <hi>Medium,</hi> for in the <hi>Looking-Glaſs</hi> it doth appear as an Object which it doe's not out of it. But what doe's ſet it out moſt naturally, is, that it is ſo in <hi>Man;</hi> For the Soul or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative Principle of a Man, as it is Extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded throughout the whole Capacity of the Body, in like manner as the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is, throughout that of the Univerſe; ſo it is <hi>Singularized</hi> and Individuated, in, and by, the particular <hi>Organs:</hi> inſomuch that the
<hi>Eye</hi> only does <hi>See;</hi> the <hi>Ear</hi> only does <hi>Hear,</hi> and only the <hi>Tongue Taſts,</hi> in Vertue thereof; for which Reaſon theſe are owned to have ſeveral particular <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> which are as ſo many ſeveral Souls unto them. Now what the Organs are to the Soul in any Body (that is but a Syſtem of Organs,) Bodies themſelves are, unto the
<hi>Moſaical</hi> Spirit, the great Soul of the Univerſe, of which all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Bodies are Organs. But ſince this Notion is of ſo much Importance, that it will deſerve a more particular Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I deſign to give it one in another Chapter, I ſhall diſmiſs it at preſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further Inſiſting on it; and now will only add ſome
<hi>Improvement</hi> to the former Diſcourſe, by making a
<hi>Compariſon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65808:82"/>the Vital and the Mechanical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then I lay it down as certain, that there is ſuch a thing as a <hi>Vital,</hi> as well as a <hi>Mechanical</hi> Energy: by
<hi>Vital Energy</hi> I mean all that is not meerly Mechanical; and therefore do comprehend in that Term whatever is properly <hi>Mental;</hi> by
<hi>Mechanical Energy</hi> I mean Impulſe or Springines, the neareſt Phyſical Principle of Actual Local Motion. Now we are as ſure by our ſenſes, and by the Reflection that we make upon our ſelves, and upon the Notices which we receive from Things without us, that there is ſuch a thing as a <hi>Vital</hi> Energy, as we are that there is a <hi>Mechanical:</hi> Becauſe we are as much aſſured of the Effects of the <hi>one,</hi> as we are of thoſe of the <hi>other;</hi> as much aſſured that there is Life, Senſation, and Intellection, that come from a Vital; as we are that there are Actual Local Motions; Motions of Aſcent and Deſcent, Motions Direct, and Motions Circular, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which (as Motions) come from Impulſe, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Energy.</p>
                  <p>Again; As it is Certain that <hi>Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or that Impulſe which is the neareſt Phyſical Principle of it, is <hi>not</hi> Matter, or Materiate, but yet is <hi>in</hi> Matter, as United unto it: ſo by this Conſideration we may<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65808:83"/>become as certain, that
<hi>Vital Energy</hi> and the Effects of it, <hi>though</hi> they be Immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>yet</hi> they may be in Matter; ſince there needs no more of Hooks and Crooks to make the Latter, than to make the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to ſtick, and hold together.</p>
                  <p>In the next place; As the Mechanical, or Loco-motive Energy is Diffuſed <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World</hi> (for there is nothing in this, that is Entirely at Reſt;) ſo is the Vital: Since it is certain that wherever, and whenever, any Matter becomes Diſpoſed, the Vital Principle is
<hi>always at hand</hi> to Actuate that Matter, and Act in it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Diſpoſitions of it do Invite or Permit: All <hi>Putrefaction</hi> or Digeſtion <hi>any where,</hi> determines in <hi>Inſects,</hi> or little Animals, (as Experience evinces,) the Spirits being Unfettered and let Looſe thereby.</p>
                  <p>And yet <hi>as</hi> the Mechanick or Loco-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Impulſe is not Received in all Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Matter indifferently, but that, (as I have ſhowed already) there muſt for ſome certain Modifications of Local Motion, be certain particular Textures of Matter, <hi>ſo</hi> neither is the Vital Energy Catcht and Received indifferently by all Textures of Matter; but as all Life conſiſts in Motion, or in ſomething Analogous, ſo for certain Gradations and Exerciſes of<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65808:83"/>Life, there muſt be cerain particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks and Textures of Matter, called <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> and alſo certain particular Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the <hi>Mechanical Spirits</hi> (for ſo I call the ſubtle Active Corpuſcles in every Concrete) that are the immediate inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Vital Principle in all its Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Life, in this Corporeal World.</p>
                  <p>So that as Actual Motion, the Effect of Loco-motive Energy, and even Loco-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Energy it ſelf (as taken for Impulſe) is not Material in this Senſe, that it does <hi>conſiſt</hi> of Matter, yet, if to be material be underſtood of that which is <hi>Dependent on</hi> Matter, and ſo Dependent that it cannot be without it; in the Senſe of the word, not only actual Motion, but even <hi>Impulſe</hi> (the neareſt Phyſical principle of Motion) is material, ſince neither of them can be but in, and by the means of Matter. In like manner, the Vital Principle that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates Corporeal Beings, though it is not material in this Senſe, that it is
<hi>only</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or a mode of Matter, yet in another it is, that it
<hi>ſo Depends</hi> in all its Animal Operations, that it cannot exerciſe any but by means of Mater, and according to the Texture and Quality of it. Nothing can be plainer than this is to Senſe, for in all the Acts of Perception, not only the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but the Intellectual, <hi>as</hi> the Organs<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65808:84"/>are, ſo are the Actions; if the Organs are ſound and duly Diſpoſed, the Actions are Conformable; but if the Organs are out of Tune and Vitiated, the Actions are ſo likewiſe; Ay, are Totally Aboliſhed, if the Organs are ſpoiled; Beſides, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kinds, and Degrees, of Deliration, that men themſelves are Subject unto, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as their Spirits are ill Qualified and Diſtempered, do further Confirm it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, as the Vital Energy it Diffuſed (as Light is) throughout the Univerſe; ſo according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Textures of Matter that do catch it, as a <hi>Speculum</hi> does the Light, it Exerts it ſelf; and being Catcht and Retained by the <hi>Congruity</hi> of the Body, (for it is Congruity only, not Hooks or Crooks, that holds them together,) it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Soul,</hi> and the whole Complex, [of Body and Soul] an
<hi>Animal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid, does more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly regard the
<hi>Animals,</hi> I call <hi>Viſible,</hi> which we are better Acquainted with, than with <hi>others of a Higher Nature;</hi> but yet, with a very eaſie Application, and by way of Analogy, it will alſo open the Nature of

<hi>Incorporeal,</hi> will be beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ſhewing the reaſon how the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of being <hi>Corporeal</hi> becomes <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated</hi> unto viſible Animals; to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend which, we muſt conſider, that in order to our converſing with Objects, and taking Cognizance of them, we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with <hi>two</hi> ſorts of Faculties, the <hi>Senſe,</hi> and the
<hi>Underſtanding;</hi> and that the <hi>Senſe</hi> (even to Senſe) is an
<hi>Organical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> Power, for we do ſee the Organs it uſes, the Eye for Seeing, the Ear for Hearing, and the like for all the reſt; but that the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is (to <hi>Senſe</hi>) an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>organical Immaterial</hi> Power, there not <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing</hi> any <hi>Senſible Organ,</hi> by means of<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65808:86"/>which, it does exert or put forth its Acts. Now in conformity to this <hi>Diſtinction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Faculties, we do make <hi>one</hi> of their Objects, (nor can we do it more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably:) calling the Subſtances that do properly come under the notice and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our ſenſe, <hi>Bodies;</hi> and thoſe that do not, but are only inferred and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the underſtanding, <hi>Spirits:</hi> the former are corporeal material Subſtances; becauſe perceived by
<hi>ſenſe,</hi> which is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Organical Power; but the latter, ſuch as Angels and other Spirits, are ſaid to be immaterial, incorporeal, becauſe we <hi>cannot</hi> See, or Feel, or Taſt, or Smell them in their own Subſiſtences: In a word, we cannot perceive them in their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per beings by any of the <hi>Senſes</hi> we have, but only by the Ratiocination and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> which (to ſenſe) is an Inorganical Immaterial Power. And our Saviour Chriſt, when after his Reſurrection, he appeared to his Diſciples, and they apprehended that they had ſeen a Viſion, to convince them of the Reality of his
<hi>Corporeal</hi> Exiſtence, and that he was not a Spirit, or an Apparition only, as they took him to be, he Appeals unto their <hi>Senſe,</hi> and particularly to that of <hi>Touch, Luke</hi> 24.39. Behold, ſays he, <hi>my Hands, and my Feet, that it is I my</hi>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:65808:86"/>
                     <hi>ſelf, for a Spirit hath no Fleſh and Bones as you ſee me have:</hi> Wherein he goes upon theſe Notions, that a <hi>Spirit</hi> is an inviſible Thing, a Thing that in its own reality cannot be ſeen, nor be felt, but only be underſtood; and that, that ſubſtance which comes under the notice and cogniſance of the ſenſe is a <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this ſenſe of the word [Body] all Spirits are really un-imbodied incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real things; they have not <hi>ſuch</hi> Bodies of Fleſh and Bone, or Organs that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Obſervation and notices of
<hi>ſenſe,</hi> as we have; but in another ſenſe of the word, as Body is not taken reſtrainedly, for that only which is <hi>ſenſible,</hi> but more largely, for <hi>any Syſtem of Matter</hi> whatever, (whether ſo refined and ſubtle that it comes not within the compaſs of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſe, or ſo groſs, that it may be perceived by it;) ſo Spirits are Corporeal and Embodied: That is, they are mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial (as well as mental) Beings; minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are, but Minds <hi>in Matter,</hi> or Animals. In this,
<hi>Scaliger</hi> conſents with me, who in his Exercitations (<hi>Exerc.</hi>
307. §. 38.) boldly ſays, <hi>Spiritus Latinis &amp; Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Omnibus, Philoſophis, Medicis, Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, Corpus eſt: id eſt, Materia, &amp; Forma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will be Evident, if we conſider (1.) That Abſolute Purity, or Exemption<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65808:87"/>from <hi>all</hi> Matter, is the peculiar <hi>Prerogative of God,</hi> who only is Pure Light, without any mixture of Darkneſs; it is only <hi>he,</hi> the Central Being, (he that is abſolute pure being) that is pure unmixed mind; all other beings but
<hi>he</hi> muſt be impure, and have ſome ingredience of <hi>matter</hi> in their Compoſition; without <hi>which,</hi> as they would be pure Mind, ſo (being pure mind) they would be God. Secondly, Were all or any Spirits, except the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Almighty <hi>Center</hi> and Spring of All Abſolutely pure, without any mixture of Matter; abſolutely ſimple, without any Real Compoſition; there could be no <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi> among them, either in Reſpect of <hi>Kinds,</hi> or of <hi>Individuals;</hi> ſince
<hi>Alterity</hi> (and where there is Diſtinction, there muſt be Alterity;
<hi>unus &amp; alius, eſt alter &amp; alter,</hi>) cannot conſiſt with
<hi>Abſolute ſimplicity;</hi> Compoſition is <hi>Unity,</hi> but ſimplicity is <hi>Unicity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be more Particular; were Spirits Abſolutely Pure and Simple, without any Admiſſion of Matter, there could be no Diſtinction among them in reſpect of <hi>Kinds.</hi> For what ſhould difference them? if there were nothing in them but that, wherein they did all agree; as there would be nothing elſe but that, if all of them were pure and ſimple: Things that <hi>Differ</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:65808:87"/>in ſomething, and withal in ſomething <hi>Agree,</hi> cannot be <hi>Pure</hi> or <hi>Simple:</hi> for all have ſomething that is <hi>Common,</hi> in which they do agree, and all ſomething <hi>not</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in which they differ; it is plain, that each of them Conſiſts of Thing, and Thing; and Things that Conſiſt of Thing and Thing are Compounded; not Pure and Simple Things.</p>
                  <p>Again, were Spirits abſolutely pure and ſimple, without any Concretion of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there could be no diſtinction among them as to
<hi>Individuals,</hi> as well as none in relation to Kinds. For ſince all Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (except only that of the Central pure mind) is
<hi>Numerication,</hi> and all Numerica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes from Diviſion, and Diviſion has no place but in Matter, or in Things by means of matter. It is evident that there can be no diſtinction of Spirits as to Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduation, if there be no ingredience of matter in their making. Things are ſaid to differ
<hi>in number,</hi> (and ſo all Individuals differ, as well thoſe of one and the ſame, as thoſe of divers <hi>Species,</hi>) that however identified they be in other Reſpects, yet do ſo differ, that one is not the other; which cannot be without Diviſion, of one from the other; nor Diviſion be without matter: <hi>Unum</hi> is not only <hi>Indiviſum in ſe,</hi> but
<hi>Diviſum à Quolibet alio.</hi> As for <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:65808:88"/>Matter and Metaphyſical <hi>Form,</hi> or that diſtinction that ſome make of (ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> they are but <hi>meer Words,</hi> without any ſignification (at leaſt in my underſtanding,) if they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>Matter</hi> and
<hi>Mind;</hi> which are the <hi>only</hi> Metaphyſical Principles of Things, that are <hi>Exiſtent</hi> and Real. In ſhort, we may obſerve <hi>in our ſelves,</hi> (that Mind as I have noted before) is <hi>Individuated by Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſince even ſenſe is ſeeing in the <hi>Eye;</hi> Hearing in the <hi>Ear;</hi> Taſting in the <hi>Tongue,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another Conſideration that Induces me to believe, that all Spirits are <hi>Animals,</hi> and vitally united unto Matter, of one ſort or another, is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in a Diſcourſe of his Concerning the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. doe's Speak of a
<hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Body, in Contradiction to a <hi>Natural,</hi> as of the Body that All that do Ariſe in Chriſt ſhall be Cloathed withal; and Chriſt himſelf tells us, that All that ſhall Attain that glorious Reſurrection, ſhall be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<hi>as</hi> Glorified Men; that is, they muſt have Bodies, tho' Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Spiritual Bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:65808:88"/>In fine, that Spirits are
<hi>Incorporeal</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this ſenſe, that they have not ſuch Groſs Elementary Bodies as we have, of Fleſh and Blood and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that they are <hi>ſo</hi> in every ſenſe of that word; eſpecially if we Conſider, that (as the Apoſtle aſſures us) there may be <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bodies;</hi> and there Appears not any Incoherence (in this,) that Spirits ſhould have Spiritual Bodies. Beſides, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it ſelf, that, unto ſenſe, is an
<hi>Inorganical</hi> Immaterial Faculty, is not Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely <hi>ſo,</hi> but has the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> for an Organ, ſince as theſe are Diſpoſed and Textured, well or ill, even ſo the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of that noble power, are either right, or depraved; and from the differences in
<hi>theſe</hi> Spirits do come the differences of <hi>Wits,</hi> which are many. Ay, poſſibly thoſe Animal Spirits (or ſomething that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them) may compoſe the <hi>Body</hi> which accompanies the departing Soul: for that ſome kind of Body does, which in the <hi>Greek</hi> is called

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Learned <hi>Origen</hi> has told us, L. 2. <hi>Contra Celſum:</hi> which <hi>Body</hi> he alſo ſays, is <hi>that,</hi> the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Soul is uſed to appear in; but as to this, I ſhall offer ſomething hereafter.</p>
                  <p>By this Diſcourſe it is Evident againſt Mr.
<hi>Hobbs,</hi> and others of the Sadducean Opinion, that Spirits in their own Nature<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65808:89"/>are Real and <hi>Subſiſtent Beings,</hi> and not meerly <hi>Powers,</hi> or <hi>Operations</hi> and <hi>Actions;</hi> tho at the ſame time it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that in the Language of the
<hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſuch <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Directive</hi> Qualities as are <hi>Intelligible</hi> only, and do not come directly within the Cognizance of the ſenſe are called <hi>Spirits;</hi> thus we read of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of
<hi>Government</hi> and of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that was firſt upon
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and afterward imparted to the 70 Elders, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. of a Spirit of <hi>Wiſdom, Deut.</hi> 4.9. of the Spirit of
<hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Might;</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and of the <hi>Fear</hi> of the Lord,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. Ay, that vexatious Diſtemper that afflicted
<hi>Saul,</hi> and that ſeems to have been nothing elſe but melancholly, is called an Evil Spirit from the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. and in
<hi>Luke</hi> 13.11, 12. we read of a Spirit of <hi>Infirmity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But tho' Spirit in the Holy Scriptures is often taken in the inſtanced ſenſe; and that the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Angel</hi> is a Name of <hi>Office,</hi> rather than of <hi>Nature;</hi> yet it is certain, that Angels are repreſented in thoſe Sacred Writings as <hi>Real</hi> ſubſiſting Beings, all as real and ſubſiſting as men themſelves are, if the aſcribing to <hi>them</hi> the like Affections, Offices, and Perſonal Operations, that<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65808:89"/>Men have, and do execute and exert, can prove them ſo.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That there are Spirits, proved by General Tradition. Mr.
<hi>Hobb</hi>'s Anſwer to this Argument ſhewed to be but an Evaſion, from the Evangeliſts <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AND this reminds me of the <hi>Second</hi> Point I have propoſed to Diſcourſe on, in relation to Spirits, and that is, their
<hi>Exiſtence</hi> or Being; wherein I ſhall endeavour to make it manifeſt, that really there are ſuch Subſiſtent intellectual Beings, as are incorporated, but inviſible, which commonly we call <hi>Spirits;</hi> ſo that the Names of Spirits, both of the Good ones, as <hi>Raphael, Gabriel, &amp;c.</hi> And of the Evil ones, as <hi>Belzebub, &amp;c.</hi> are Names of
<hi>Subſtances</hi> or Perſons, and not of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities only; ay, are
<hi>proper,</hi> and not (as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> tells us, the name of
<hi>Sathan</hi> and <hi>Devil</hi> is) only <hi>Appellative</hi> Names.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Argument that I will uſe to Evidence that there are Spirits, ſhall be taken from the <hi>General Tradition</hi> of the World; it being received among all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as well the Civilized, as the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65808:90"/>and among all <hi>Philoſophers</hi> except the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> the Ancient and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, and <hi>ſome</hi> Peripateticks; and to me it is very unintelligible, how ſuch a Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould obtain ſo generally, if it had not ſome foundation of Truth; for
<hi>who</hi> ſhould ſpread the Opinion to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? and
<hi>what</hi> ſhould make it to take?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himſelf acknowledges it a truth, that the belief of Spirits was very general all the World over; only he has a way (which is peculiar to him) of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cogency and Force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore I will here conſider what he ſays.</p>
                  <p>It is true, ſays he,
<q rend="inline">'that the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and all the Nations of the World have acknowledged that there be Spirits, which for the moſt part they hold to be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, whereby it may be thought that a man by natural Reaſon may arrive without the Scriptures to the knowledge of this, that Spirits are, but the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Collection thereof by the Heathens, may proceed as I have ſaid before, from the ignorance of the Cauſe of Ghoſts and Fantoms, and ſuch other Apparitions. And from thence had the
<hi>Grecians</hi> their number of Gods, their number of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons good, or bad, and for every Man his Genius, which is not the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65808:90"/>of this truth, that Spirits are, but a falſe Opinion concerning the force of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> in his Treatiſe of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature,
<hi>Ch.</hi> 11. <hi>S.</hi> 6. wherein he plainly Affirms, that Spirits and Ghoſts are meer Fantomes, or Effects of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: a conceit, in which he ſeems to have the Concurrence of <hi>Seneca,</hi> for this Philoſopher Epiſt. 24. tells us as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> doe's, <hi>Nemo tam Puer eſt ut Cerberum ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat, &amp; Tenebras, &amp; LARVARUM habitum nudis oſſibus Cohaerentium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Notion</hi> of Spirits, that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> Inſinuates, Reminds me of <hi>Another,</hi> that a Perſon whom I knew, and who was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted not of the Wiſeſt, had of them; for being Asked what he thought a <hi>Spirit</hi> was, He Anſwered, that it was the <hi>Shadow of Concſcience;</hi> and further Demanded, concerning a <hi>Good Angel,</hi> what that was; He Replied, a Good is the Shadow of a <hi>Good</hi> Conſcience, and a <hi>Devil</hi> the Shadow of a <hi>Bad</hi> one, And Methinks he comes near to Mr. <hi>Hobbs.</hi> But without jeſting.</p>
                  <p>I Find, that <hi>Apparitions</hi> of Spirits are ſtiled
<hi>Fantoms</hi> [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

6.49.

For the Diſciples that believed our Lord to be a Spirit, <hi>Appearing,</hi> and therefore ſaid he was a <hi>Phantaſm</hi> (which it ſeems was the uſual Expreſſion at that time for ſuch Apparitions,) did withal believe that a Spirit was a <hi>Reality,</hi> and of great Power.

                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<hi>They cried out,</hi> (<hi>for They all ſaw him and were</hi> Troubled,) Mark. 6.49, 50. I would De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> were he Alive, what can be Conceived to occaſion ſo much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, ſo much Affrightment, in the Diſciples, at the Apparition of a Spirit,<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65808:91"/>if they did not take a Spirit to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Real, tho' they called the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it a Phantome. Certainly, when they were ſo much Affrighted at it, They muſt be Apprehenſive that it was a Thing of Great Power, that was come to hurt Them; for elſe, had They believed it to be a meer Effect of Their own Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they would have been as <hi>Unconcerned,</hi> as Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> himſelf would be, at ſuch an Appearance.</p>
                  <p>I Conclude then, that as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> was not the Firſt that called Spirits <hi>Phantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> or Fantomes, but that they were called ſo of Old, (and indeed the word <hi>Spectrum</hi> in the Latin, and this of <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition</hi> in the Engliſh Tongue, does an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer very Properly to the word <hi>Phantaſma</hi> in the Greek, a word too Adopted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe;) ſo this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination was Given to them, not with Deſign to ſignify their <hi>Nature</hi> and Eſſence, (as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would have it,) but to ſet out the uſual <hi>way</hi> of Their Appearing, of which more hereafter. This is Evident from the Younger <hi>Pliny,</hi> who in one of his Epiſtles, having put the Queſtion, whether Apparitions or <hi>Phantaſmata</hi> (for this is the word he uſes) were Real and ſubſiſtent Things, he Affirms they are, and Inſtances in ſeveral Remarkable Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65808:92"/>(as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) to Prove it.</p>
                  <p>So that this Firſt Argument for the Real Exiſtence of Spirits, taken from the General belief that all the World has of it (as Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> himſelf Acknowledges,) doe's hold Good and Concluſive, Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that this Philoſopher has ſuggeſted againſt it. And indeed what he Propoſes, is ſaid ſo <hi>Timorouſly</hi> by him,

                     <p>I have Read in <hi>Purchas,</hi> that a certain
<hi>Indian,</hi> a Great <hi>Raja,</hi> and Greater <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> was brought to a Confeſſion, as well as Conviction of his Folly, by a ſtrange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. The Relation in that Author, goes in theſe Terms.
<q rend="inline">"A Great <hi>Raja</hi> a Gentile, a Notorious <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of all Deity, Glorying to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs he knew no other <hi>God</hi> than the <hi>King,</hi> nor believing nor fearing none: ſitting Dallying with his Women, one of them plucked a

I have here a very Large Field, but my Buſineſs being not to handle this Subject as a Common Place, but only to Touch it by way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall content my ſelf with the General Mention of
<hi>Prodigies,</hi> that all Hiſtory, Ancient and Modern, abounds withal; and the ſtrange Performances of <hi>Witches</hi> and Wizards; of which Laſt I will give an <hi>Inſtance</hi> or two, that carry great Credibility, and yet are Abſolutely<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65808:93"/>

But the Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> being Related by an Author not in every Bodies hand, I will lay it out at large in all its Circumſtances, as I Find them ſet down by him, that ſo Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, who have the Curioſity to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into Things of this Nature, may have the ſurer Grounds to go upon, in making their Judgment.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Pinola</hi> (ſay's Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> in his new Survey of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> C. 20.) there were ſome who were much given to Witchcraft, and by the Power of the Devil did Act ſtrange things; amongſt the Reſt there was one Old Woman Named <hi>Martha de Carillo,</hi> who had been by ſome of the Town formerly Accuſed for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching many; but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Juſtices quitted her, finding no ſure Evidence againſt her; with this ſhe grew worſe and worſe, and did much Harm; when I was there, two or three died, <hi>withering away,</hi> Declaring at their Death that this <hi>Carillo</hi> had Killed them, and that they <hi>ſaw her</hi> often about their Beds, threatning them with a Frowning and Angry Look. The <hi>Indians</hi> for fear of her durſt not complain againſt her, nor meddle with her; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſent word unto <hi>Don Juan de Guzman</hi>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:65808:94"/>the Lord of that Town, that if he took not order with her, ſhe would deſtroy his Town. He Hearing of it, got for me a Commiſſion from the Biſhop and another Officer of the Inquiſition to make Diligent and Private Inquiry after her Life and Actions, which I did, and found among the
<hi>Indians</hi> many and Grievous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt her, moſt of the Town Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that certainly ſhe was a Notorious Witch, and that before her former Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſhe was wont witherſoever ſhe went about the Town to go with a <hi>Duck</hi> Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her, which when ſhe came to the Church would ſtay at the door till ſhe came out again, and then would Return home with her, which Duck they Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was her Beloved Devil and Familiar Spirit, for that they had often ſet Dogs at her and they would not meddle with her, but rather run away from her. This Duck never Appeared more with her,
<hi>ſince</hi> ſhe was formerly Accuſed before the Juſtice, which was thought to be her policy, that ſhe might be no more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected thereby. This Old Woman was a Widow, and of the <hi>Pooreſt</hi> of the Town in outward ſhew, and yet ſhe had always ſtore of <hi>Money,</hi> which none could tell which way ſhe might come by it. Whilſt I was thus Taking Privy Information<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65808:94"/>againſt her (it being the Time of
<hi>Lent,</hi> when all the Town came to Confeſſion) ſhe among the Reſt came to the Church to <hi>Confeſs</hi> her ſins, and brought me the beſt Preſent and Offering of all the Town; for whereas a Riall is Common, ſhe brought me four, and beſides, a <hi>Turkey, Eggs, Fiſh,</hi> and a little Bottle of <hi>Honey.</hi> She thought thereby to get with me a better Opinion than I had of her from the whole Town. I Accepted of her Great Offering, and heard her Confeſſion, which was of nothing but Trifles, which could ſcarce be Judged ſinful Actions. I Examined her very cloſe of what was the Common Judgment of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> and eſpecially of thoſe who dying, had declared to my ſelf <hi>at their Death</hi> that She had Bewitched them, and before their Sickneſs had <hi>Threatned</hi> them, and in their Sickneſs <hi>Appeared</hi> Threatning them with Death about their beds, none but they themſelves ſeeing her; to which ſhe Replyed Weeping that ſhe was Wronged. I Asked her, <hi>how</hi> ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Poor Widow without any Sons to help her, without any means of Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, had ſo much Money, as to give me more than the Richeſt of the Town; <hi>how</hi> She came by that Fiſh, Turkey, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, having none of this of her own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Houſe? to which ſhe <hi>Replied,</hi>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:65808:95"/>that God Loved her and gave her all theſe Things, and that with her Money ſhe Bought the reſt. I
<hi>Asked</hi> her <hi>of whom?</hi> She <hi>Anſwered</hi> that out of the Town ſhe had them. I Perſuaded her to much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to forſake the Devil and all Fellowſhip with him; but her Words and Anſwers were of a Saintly and Holy Woman; and ſhe earneſtly deſired me to give her the
<hi>Communion</hi> with the Reſt that were to Receive the next day. Which I told her I durſt not do, uſing Chriſt's Words, Give not the Childrens bread unto dogs, nor caſt your Pearls unto Swine; and it would be a great Scandal to give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion unto her, who was ſuſpected ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and had been Accuſed for a <hi>Witch.</hi> This ſhe took very ill, telling me that ſhe had many Years <hi>Received</hi> the Communion, and now in her Old Age it Grieved her to be Deprived of it, her tears were many, yet I could not be moved with them, but Reſolutely denied her the Communion, and ſo Diſmiſſed her. At Noon when I had done my work in the Church, I bad my Servants go to gather up the Offerings, and gave order to have the
<hi>Fiſh</hi> Dreſſed for my Dinner which ſhe had brought, but no ſooner was it carried into the Kitchen, when the Cook looking on it found it
<hi>full of Maggots,</hi> and ſtinking; ſo<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65808:95"/>that I was forced to hurl it away; with that I began to ſupect my Old Witch, and went to look on her <hi>Honey,</hi> and Pouring it out into a Diſh, I found it full of <hi>Worms;</hi> her <hi>Eggs</hi> I could not know from others, there being near a Hundred Offered that day, but after as I uſed them, we found ſome
<hi>Rotten,</hi> ſome with <hi>dead Chickens</hi> in them; the next Morning the <hi>Turkey</hi> was found dead; As for her four <hi>Rials,</hi> I could not Perceive whether ſhe had Bewitched them out of my Pocket, for that I had put them with many other, which that day had been given Given me, yet as far as I could I called to Memory <hi>who</hi> and <hi>what</hi> had been Given me, and in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reckoning I verily thought that I miſſed <hi>four</hi> Rials; At Night when my Servants the <hi>Indians</hi> were gone to Bed, I ſat up late in my Chamber betaking my ſelf to my Books and Study, for I was the next Morning to make an Exhortation to thoſe that Received the Communion. After I had Studied a while, it being between Ten and Eleven of the Clock; on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the <hi>Chief door</hi> in the Hall (where in a Lower Room was my Chamber, and the Servants, and <hi>three other</hi> doors) flew <hi>open,</hi> and I heard one <hi>come in,</hi> and for a while <hi>walk about;</hi> then was
<hi>Another</hi> door opened which went into a Little Room,<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65808:96"/>where my Saddles were Laid; with this I thought it might be the Black-More <hi>Miguel Dalva,</hi> who would often come late to my Houſe to Lodge there, Eſpecially ſince my fear of <hi>Montenegro,</hi> and I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that he was Laying up his Saddle, I called unto him by his Name two or three times, from within my Chamber, but no Anſwer was made, but ſuddenly <hi>Another door</hi> that went out to a Garden flew alſo open, wherewith I began with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to <hi>fear,</hi> my joynts Trembled, my Hair ſtood up, I would have called out to the Servants, and my Voice was as it were ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with the ſudden Affrightment; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of the Witch, and put my truſt in God againſt her and Encouraged my ſelf and Voice, calling out to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and knocking with a Cane at my door within that they might hear me, for I durſt not open it and go out; with the Noiſe that I made the Servants Awaked, and came out to my Chamber door; then I opened it, and asked them if they had not heard ſome Body in the Hall, and all the doors opened, they ſaid they were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, and heard nothing, only one
<hi>Boy</hi> ſaid he <hi>heard all,</hi> and Related unto me the
<hi>ſame</hi> that I had heard; I took my Candle then in my hand and went out with them into the Hall to view the <hi>doors,</hi> and I found them
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65808:96"/>all <hi>ſhut,</hi> as the Servants ſaid they had left them. Then I Perceived that the <hi>Witch</hi> would have Affrighted me, but had no power to do me any harm; I made two of the Servants lie in my Chamber, and went to bed; in the morning early I ſent for my <hi>Fiſcal</hi> the Clerk of the Church, and told him what had happen'd that Night, he ſmiled upon me, and told me it was the Widdow <hi>Carillo,</hi> who had often played ſuch Tricks in the Town with thoſe that had offended her, and therefore he had the night before come unto me from her, deſiring me to give her the Communion, leſt ſhe ſhould do me ſome hurt, which I denied unto him, as I had done to her ſelf; the Clerk bad me be of good cheer, for he knew ſhe had no power over me to do me any hurt. After the Communion that day, ſome of the Chief <hi>Indians</hi> came unto me, and told me that Old <hi>Carillo</hi> had <hi>Boaſted</hi> that ſhe would play me <hi>ſome trick</hi> or other, becauſe I would not give her the Communion. But I, to rid the Town of ſuch a Limb of Satan, ſent her to <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temala,</hi> with all the Evidences and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which I had found againſt her, unto the Preſident and Biſhop, who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her to be put in Priſon, where ſhe died within two months.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:65808:97"/>Many more <hi>Indians</hi> there were in that Town, who were ſaid in my time to do very <hi>ſtrange</hi> things. One called <hi>John Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalez,</hi> was reported to <hi>Change</hi> himſelf into the ſhape of a Lion, and in that ſhape was one day ſhot in the noſe by a poor harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who chiefly got his living by going about the Woods and Mountains, and ſhooting at Wild Deer, and other Beaſts to make Mony of them. He eſpied one day a <hi>Lion,</hi> and having no other aim at him but his Snout behind a Tree, he ſhot at him, the
<hi>Lion</hi> ran away; the ſame day this <hi>Gonzalez</hi> was taken ſick; I was ſent for to hear his Confeſſion, I ſaw his face and noſe all bruiſed, and asked <hi>how</hi> it came? he told me then that he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from a Tree, and almoſt killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet afterwards he accuſed the poor <hi>Spaniard</hi> for ſhooting at him; the buſineſs was examined by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Juſtice, my Evidence was taken for what
<hi>Gonzalez</hi> told me of his fall from a Tree; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was put to his Oath, who ſwore that he ſhot at a Lion in a Thick Wood, where an
<hi>Indian</hi> could ſcarce be thought to have any buſineſs; the Tree was found out in the Wood, whereat the ſhot had been made, and was ſtill marked with the ſhot and Bullet; which <hi>Gonzalez</hi> confeſſed was to be the place; and was Examined how<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65808:97"/>he neither fell nor was ſeen by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> when he came to ſeek for the Lion, thinking he had killed him; to which he anſwered, that he ran away leſt the
<hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> ſhould kill him indeed. But his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers ſeemed frivolous, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity being known, and the great ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that was in the Town, of <hi>Gonzalez</hi> his dealing with the Devil, cleared the <hi>Spaniard</hi> from what was laid againſt him.</p>
                     <p>But this was nothing to what after hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to one <hi>John Gomez,</hi> the chiefeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of that Town of near fourſcore years of Age, the Head and Ruler of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palleſt Tribe among the
<hi>Indians,</hi> whoſe Advice and Counſel was taken and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before all the reſt; who ſeemed to be a very <hi>Godly</hi> Indian, and very ſeldom miſſed Morning and Evening Prayers in the Church, and had beſtowed great Riches there. This <hi>Indian</hi> very ſuddenly was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſick (I being then in my other Town of <hi>Mixco</hi>) the
<hi>Mayordomos</hi> or Stewards of the Sodality of the Virgin, fearing that he might die without Confeſſion, and they be chid for their negligence, at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night called me up at <hi>Mixco,</hi> deſiring me to go preſently and help <hi>John Gomez</hi> to die, whom alſo they ſaid deſired much to ſee me, and to receive ſome comfort from<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65808:98"/>me. I judging it a work of Charity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the time of the night were unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and the great Rain at the preſent might have ſtopped my Charity, yet I would not be hindred by either of them, and ſo ſet forth to ride nine Miles both in the Dark, and Wet. When I came to <hi>Pinola,</hi> being thorow wet to the skin, I went immediately to the Houſe of Old Sick <hi>Gomez,</hi> who lay with his face all muffled up, thanked me for my pains and care I had for his Soul, he deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and by his Confeſſion and Weeping Evidenced nothing but a Godly Life, and a willing deſire to die, and to be with Chriſt, I comforted him, and prepared him for Death, and before I departed, asked him how he felt himſelf; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that his Sickneſs was nothing but Old Age, and Weakneſs; with this I went to my Houſe, changed my ſelf, and lay down a while to reſt, when ſuddenly I was called up again to give <hi>Gomez</hi> the Extream Unction, which the <hi>Indians</hi> (as they have been ignorantly taught) will not omit to receive before they die. As I Anointed him in his Noſe, his Lips, his Eyes, his Hands and his Feet, I perceived that he was ſwelled, and black and blew, but made nothing of it, judging it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſickneſs of his Body; I went
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65808:98"/>home again, being now break of the day, when after I had taken a ſmall nap, ſome <hi>Indians</hi> came to my door to buy Candles to offer up for <hi>John Gomez</hi> his Soul, whom they told me was departed, and was that day to be Buried very ſolemnly at Maſs. I aroſe with drouſie Eyes after ſo unquiet a nights reſt; and walked to the Church, where I ſaw the Grave was preparing. I met with two or three <hi>Spaniards</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved near the Town, and were come to Maſs that Morning, who went in with me to my Chamber, and with them I fell into Diſcourſe about <hi>John Gomez,</hi> telling them what comfort I had received at his Death, whom I judged to have lived very Holy, and doubted not of his Salvation, and that the Town would much want him, for that he was their Chief Guide, and Leader, Ruling them with good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Counſel. At this time the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> ſmiled one at another, and told me I was much deceived by all the
<hi>Indians,</hi> but eſpecially by the deceaſed <hi>Gomez,</hi> if I judged him to have been a Saint, and Holy Man. I told them, that they, as Enemies to the <hi>Indians,</hi> judged ſtill uncharitably of them; but that I who knew very well their Conſciences, could judge better of them than they. One then Replyed, that it ſeemed I little knew the truth of <hi>John</hi>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:65808:99"/>
                        <hi>Gomez</hi> his death by the Confeſſion which he made unto me, and that I ſeemed to be ignorant of the ſtir which was made in the Town concerning his Death. This ſeemed ſo ſtrange unto me, that I deſired them to inform me of the Truth. Then they told me that the report went, that <hi>John Gomez</hi> was the Chief <hi>Wizard</hi> of all the
<hi>Wizards</hi> and <hi>Witches</hi> in the Town, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he was wont to be changed into the ſhape of a <hi>Lion,</hi> and ſo to walk about the Mountains. That he was ever a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enemy to one <hi>Sebaſtian Lopez</hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Indian,</hi> and head of another Tribe; and that both of them two days before had met in the Mountain. <hi>Gomez</hi> in the ſhape of a <hi>Lion,</hi> and <hi>Lopez</hi> in the ſhape of a
<hi>Tyger;</hi> and that they fought moſt cruelly, till <hi>Gomez</hi> (who was the older and weaker) was tired, much bit and bruiſed, and died of it. And farther, that I might be aſſured of this truth, they told me that
<hi>Lopez</hi> was in Priſon for it, and the two Tribes ſtriving about it, and that the Tribe and Kindred of <hi>Gomez</hi> demanded from <hi>Lopez</hi> and his Tribe and Kindred ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and a great Sum of Money, or elſe did threaten to make the Caſe known unto the Spaniſh Power and Authority, which yet they were unwilling to do, if they could agree and ſmother it up among<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65808:99"/>themſelves, that they might not bring an aſperſion upon their whole Town. This ſeemed very ſtrange unto me, and I could not reſolve what to believe, and thought I would never more believe an <hi>Indian,</hi> if I found <hi>John Gomez</hi> to have ſo much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled and Deceived me. I took my leave of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and went my ſelf to the Priſon, where I found <hi>Lopez</hi> with Fetters. I called one of the Officers of the Town, who was <hi>Alguazil Major,</hi> and my great Friend, unto my Houſe, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately examined him why <hi>Lopez</hi> was kept ſo cloſe Priſoner? he was loath to tell me, fearing the reſt of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and hoping the buſineſs would be taken up and agreed by the two Tribes, and not noiſed about the Country, which at that inſtant the two Alcades and Regidores, Majors, and Jurates, with the Chief of both Tribes were ſitting about in the Town-Houſe all that Morning. But I ſeeing the Officer ſo timorous, was more deſirous to know ſomething, and preſſed more upon him for the Truth, giving him an inkling of what I had heard from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To which he anſwered, that if they could agree amongſt themſelves, they feared no ill report from the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> againſt their Town; I told him I muſt know what they were agreeing upon amongſt<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65808:100"/>themſelves ſo cloſely in the Town-Houſe. He told me, if I would promiſe to ſay nothing of him (for he feared the whole Town if they ſhould know he had revealed any thing unto me) he would tell me the Truth. With this I comforted him, and gave him a Cup of Wine, and encouraged him, warranting him that no harm ſhould come unto him for what he told me. Then he related the buſineſs unto me as the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> had done, and told me that he thought the Tribes amongſt themſelves would not agree; for that ſome of <hi>Gomez</hi> his Friends hated <hi>Lopez,</hi> and all ſuch as were ſo Familiar with the Devil, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not if <hi>Gomez</hi> his diſſembling Life were laid open to the World; but others he ſaid, who were as bad as <hi>Lopez,</hi> and
<hi>Gomez,</hi> would have kept it cloſe, leſt they, and all the Witches and Wizards in the Town ſhould be diſcovered. This ſtruck me to the very heart, to think that I ſhould live amongſt ſuch People, whom I ſaw were ſpending all they could get by their Work and Labour upon the Church, Saints, and in Offerings, and yet were ſo privy to the Counſels of Satan; it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me that the word I preached unto them did no more good; and I reſolved from that time forward to ſpend moſt of my indeavours againſt Satans ſubtilty, and<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65808:100"/>to ſhew them more than I had done, the great danger of their Souls who had made any Compact with the Devil, that I might make them abandon and abjure his Works, and cloſe with Chriſt by Faith. <hi>I</hi> diſmiſſed the <hi>Indian,</hi> and went to the Church to ſee if the People were come to Maſs; I found there no body but only two who were making <hi>Gomez</hi> his Grave. I went back to my Chamber, troubled much within my ſelf, whether I ſhould allow him a Chriſtian Burial, who had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died ſo wickedly, as I had been informed. Yet I thought I was not bound to believe one <hi>Indian</hi> againſt him, nor the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom I ſuppoſed ſpoke but by hear-ſay. Whilſt I was thus muſing, there came unto me at leaſt twenty of the Chiefeſt of the Town, with the two Majors, Jurates, and all the Officers of Juſtice, who deſired me to forbear that day the Burying of <hi>John Gomez,</hi> for that they had reſolved to call a Crown Officer to view his Corps, and examine his death, leſt they ſhould all be troubled for him, and he be again unburied. I made as if I knew nothing, but inquired of them the reaſon; then they related all unto me, and told me how there were Witneſſes in the Town, who
<hi>ſaw a Lyon and a Tyger Fighting,</hi> and preſently loſt the ſight of<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65808:101"/>the Beaſts, and <hi>ſaw John Gomez, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian Lopez,</hi> much about the ſame time parting one from another, and that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>John Gomez</hi> came home bruiſed to his Bed, from whence he never roſe more, and that he declared upon his Death-Bed unto ſome of his Friends that <hi>Sebaſtian Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez</hi> had killed him; whereupon they had him in ſafe Cuſtody. Farther they told me, that though they had never known ſo much wickedneſs of theſe two Chief Heads of their Town whom they had much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and followed; yet now upon this occaſion, from the one Tribe and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were certainly informed that both of them did conſtantly deal with the Devil, which would be a great aſperſion upon their Town, but they for their parts abjured all ſuch wicked ways, and prayed me not to conceive the worſe of all for a few, whom they were reſolved to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and not ſuffer to live amongſt them. I told them I much liked their good zeal, and incouraged them as good Chriſtians to endeavour the rooting out of Satan from their Town, and they did very well in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> to the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Power of this Accident; and that if they had concealed it, they might all have been puniſhed as guilty of <hi>Gomez</hi> his death, and Agents with Satan, and his Inſtruments.<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65808:101"/>I aſſured them I had no ill conceit of them, but rather judged well of them for what they agreed to do. The Crown Officer was ſent for, who came that night and ſearched <hi>Gomez</hi> his Body; I was preſent with him, and found it all
<hi>bruiſed,</hi> ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in many places <hi>Bitten</hi> and ſore wounded. Many Evidences and ſuſpicions were brought in againſt
<hi>Lopez</hi> by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of the Town, eſpecially by
<hi>Gomez,</hi> his Friends, whereupon he was carryed away to
<hi>Guatemala,</hi> and there again was Tryed by the ſame Witneſſes, and not much Denying the Fact himſelf, was there <hi>Hanged.</hi> And
<hi>Gomez,</hi> though his Grave was opened in the Church, he was not Buried in it, but in another made Ready for him in a Ditch. So far in <hi>Gage.</hi>

But I lay more ſtreſs upon an <hi>Advertiſement</hi> I find in<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65808:103"/>
                        <hi>Theophylact Simocatta,</hi> concerning the Murther of the Emperour <hi>Mauritius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Relation of it being Particular and Circumſtantial, carries Greater Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than the Former, and will endure the Teſt. There happened, ſays the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> on the very day in which <hi>Mauritius</hi> [the Emepror] was Murdred, a thing at
<hi>Alexandria</hi> worthy to be Recorded. A certain Writing-Maſter or Scrivener (for ſo I do Adventure to interpret the word <hi>Calligraphus</hi>) being (that day) at a Merchants Houſe at a kind of Goſſips Feaſt, where he was obliged to ſtay till the Fourth Watch of the Night; as he was going homeward, being come to the <hi>Tycha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> a noted part of the City, (about midnight) he ſaw ſome of the chiefeſt <hi>Statues</hi> that ſtood there removing from off their Baſes, and at the ſame time heard a <hi>Voice</hi> that ſeemed to come from the ſame Statues, which called on him aloud, by Name, and withal, very ſhrilly, but brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Related the Accident that that day had befaln <hi>Mauritius.</hi> In the morning the Writing-Maſter goes to the Palace to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what had happened to him, which coming to the Ear of
<hi>Peter</hi> the Prefect of <hi>Aegypt</hi> then reſiding there (who was nearly Related to <hi>Simocatta</hi>) he diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inquires concerning the whole Affair,<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65808:103"/>and after he had fully informed himſelf thereof, injoyns the Relater to Secrecy, and then ſetting down, in his Note Book, the whole Relation, he waits the Event. Of this not long after, he was aſſured by an Expreſs, which on the Ninth day brought him News of the Emperours <hi>Death,</hi> and of the Time of it; and then he Declared Publickly, how that this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident had been <hi>Foretold</hi> by the Statues, or rather by the Demons, in the manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Related, and Vouched the Writing-Maſter as the Author. This is the ſum of the Story, as
<hi>Simocatta</hi> has Related it, (<hi>Hiſt. Mauritian. l.</hi> 8.
<hi>Ch.</hi> 13.) A Story that is not told at Random, or by an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Perſon, or by a Perſon Remote from the Scene, or from the time it was Acted on; but a Story told by a Grave and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Hiſtorian, who lived at the ſame time; was well acquainted with the Perſons concerned; and who made a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the Government; ſo that he had all the Advantages that could be deſired to render him certain of the truth of it. <hi>Lucilius</hi> in
<hi>Cicero l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Nat. Deor.</hi> tells us a ſtory of the like Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Elder <hi>P. Vatienus</hi> coming by night to
<hi>Rome,</hi> was Advertized by the <hi>Tyndarida</hi> in the ſhape of two young men, on White Horſes, that that day <hi>Perſes</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65808:104"/>by the Roman Army, and taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; This he Reports to the Senate, by whom he was committed to Priſon for ſpreading Falſe News; but afterwards, when it Appeared by the Conſuls Letters, that the Advertiſement was true, he was both Releaſed and Rewarded.</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Omens,</hi> than which nothing is more Ridiculous to the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and all thoſe that deny the Reality of Spirits, (ſo ſays <hi>Cicero</hi> de Nat. Deor. l. 2. <hi>Nihil tam Ierridet</hi> Epicurus <hi>quam Praedictionem rerum futurarum;</hi>) I will Inſtance in one that leaves no Room for any Evaſion, ſince I take it from a Perſon who was very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the Truth of it and yet was a Perſon as little ſubject to Superſtition, or to Fancy, as any Epicurean whatever. Sir
<hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> (for it is he I mean) in his Hiſtory of the World (<hi>B.</hi> 4. <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>S.</hi> 7.) ſays,
<q rend="inline">'The ſtrangeſt thing that I have Read of in this kind [<hi>ſpeaking of Omens</hi>] being <hi>certainly</hi> true, was, that the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Battle at <hi>Novara,</hi> All, [<hi>not one, or ſome, which might be Chance, but All,</hi>] the Doggs which Followed the
<hi>French</hi> Army Ran from them to the <hi>Switzers,</hi> Leaping and Fawning upon them, as if they had been Bred and Fed by them all their Lives.

                     <p>But to Proceed, What will an <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,</hi> or meer
<hi>Somatiſt,</hi> ſay to the <hi>Corps-Candles,</hi> or Dead Mens Lights in <hi>Wales?</hi> if all be true that is Reported of them in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Hiſtorical Diſcourſe, <hi>Ch.</hi> 6. And Methinks his Vouchers are Good. I will Relate the Account they give in their own Terms; The Firſt is one Mr.
<hi>Lewis,</hi> who in his Firſt Letter to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (<hi>October</hi>
20. 1656.) ſpeaking of the Appearance of thoſe Lights which are called
<hi>Dead-Mens Candles,</hi> before Mortality, He ſays,
<q rend="inline">'This is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in moſt of our Counties [of <hi>Wales</hi>] that I never ſcarce heard of any ſort young or old, but this is ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death, and often obſerved to part from the very Bodies of the Perſons, all along the way to the Place of Burial, and Infallibly Death will Enſue. In his <hi>Third</hi> Letter Dated
<hi>Febr.</hi> 14. 1656. He ſays, as for the <hi>Candles,</hi> all the Parts I know of <hi>Wales,</hi> as our Neighbouring Counties (as I hear) have Experience of them, I ſcarce know any Gentleman, or Miniſter of any ſtanding, but hath ſeen them; and a Neighbour of mine, will ſhortly be at
<hi>Worceſter</hi> Abiding (who hath ſeen them often, and I will Direct ſome to<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65808:105"/>Acquaint you, and upon Oath, if need be,) a very Credible Aged Perſon; for my Part, I never ſaw the Candles; but thoſe of my Houſe have, and on a Time ſome two years Paſt, it was told me by them, that Two Candles were ſeen, one Little, and a Great one, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Church way, under my Houſe, my Wife was then great with Child, and near her time, and ſhe Feared of it, and it Begat ſome fear in us about her, but juſt about a Week after, her ſelf firſt came to me (as ſomething joyed that the Fear might be over) and ſaid (as true it was) an Old Man, and a Child of the Neighbourhood Paſſed that ſame way to be Buried.</q> This ſhe and I can Depoſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus that Gentleman; who at that time (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſtiles him) was a Learned Juſtice of Peace, and ſeems by his Letters to have been a very Cautious Circumſpect Perſon, and a Perſon of Great Veracity, and therefore a Perſon who cannot be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined to go about to Deceive, or that could be Deceived himſelf in a matter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him (as this was) as of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obſervation. For it was Eaſie for him to know if the thing were of ſo General Obſervation or Note, (ſince it was but to Ask People,) and if it was, it could not be Falſe, as having the Teſtimony of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65808:105"/>Knowledge and Experience to Avow it; and if it was not, it would be Teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in him to believe it true; ſince it wanted even that Evidence that was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ground it; but it ſeems the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Inquired, and found the thing Confirmed (as he ſays) by General Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and I believe him too Honeſt to ſay it, if it had not been ſo. Beſides, what he mentions in Relation to his Wife and Family, if well Conſidered, Adds no little ſtrength to the whole Story. And in Fine, he brings one Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> for his Voucher.</p>
                     <p>This Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> in a Letter that he wrote to Mr.
<hi>B.</hi> at the Requeſt of Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> is more particular and Full than that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, in Reference to thoſe Lights, and therefore (the Matter being Rare and Curious, and well Deſerving to be made a ſubject of Inquiry by the Nobleſt Wits) I will Tranſcribe it at Large.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Third Argument from Apparitions. Three Stories of them from the Junior <hi>Pliny,</hi> in his Epiſtles. A Recent Story of an Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND the next Argument (the laſt I will inſiſt upon) to prove the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of Spirits, ſhall be taken from their
<hi>Apparition.</hi> By their Apparition, I mean their ſhewing of themſelves to Men in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (or other Animal) ſhape, and ſo converſing and dealing with them; I know the word is, and may be taken more largely, but this is the ſenſe I take it in now.</p>
                     <p>On this Occaſion I muſt mention again the Epiſtle of
<hi>Pliny,</hi> which he ſent his Friend <hi>Sura,</hi> to have his Opinion upon this Queſtion, Whether really there were any ſuch things as
<hi>Spirits,</hi> that have a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of their own, and are a kind of
<hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens;</hi> or elſe, that all are meer fancies, and effects of fear, without any ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Real Being. <hi>Pliny</hi> himſelf declares, that he believes their Real Subſiſtence, and owns he was induced to it by three <hi>Stories,</hi> which he there relates, and I will repeat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:65808:110"/>The firſt is, concerning <hi>Q. Curtius Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus,</hi> to whom being in <hi>Africk,</hi> where he followed the
<hi>Quaeſtor,</hi> that had that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince aſſigned to him, there appeared as he was walking alone, a thing in the ſhape of a Woman of great Beauty, and of a ſize much larger than ordinary, which told him that he ſhould ſee the City of <hi>Rome</hi> once again; ſhould bear very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Charges; and in fine, return unto <hi>Africk,</hi> with Supream Command, and there die. All which could not but much ſurprize a Perſon that was very mean and obſcure, (for ſo was <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> at that time,) and yet ſays <hi>Pliny,</hi> it came all to paſs to a Tittle. He adds, that
<hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> Sailing to <hi>Carthage,</hi> as ſoon as he came on ſhoar the ſame <hi>Spectre</hi> appeared to him again; and that afterward falling Sick, with a Sickneſs which none about him thought any any danger of, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what the <hi>Spectre</hi> had told him, and comparing paſt Events with future, abandon'd all hopes of recovery, and in fine, according to the Prediction of the Apparition, and to his own perſwaſion, dies in
<hi>Africk.</hi> This Story is alſo in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next is of a Magnificient Houſe in <hi>Athens,</hi> that was Haunted, but in ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a manner, that all that dwelt in it
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65808:110"/>died with the fright; ſo it lay void a long time. But at laſt, a Philoſopher called <hi>Athenodorus,</hi> coming to Town, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Houſe, and ſeeing an inſcription upon this, that it was to be Lett, and for a very low price; he liking the Houſe, and admiring the lowneſs of the price, inquires, and was fully informed of the Reaſon. He reſolves however to take it, and the rather, for that it was ſaid to be Haunted. Accordingly, in the Evening he orders a Bed to be made for him in the forward part of the Houſe, next the door, and that a Writing-Table, and a Stile to write with, as alſo Light ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; which being done, he diſpoſes all his Domeſticks in the inner part of the Houſe, and then applies himſelf to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Writing; by that means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying both his Thoughts, his Eyes, and his Hands; leaſt otherwiſe his un-ingaged mind ſhould be poſſeſſed of fear, and this impoſe upon him. While he was thus occupied, all was ſilent, ſtill, and quiet for a while; but at laſt he hears at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the clattring of Iron, and jingling of Chains, which yet did not ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb him, but that, without looking up, he continued his Writing, and incouraged himſelf all he could. In the mean time, the noiſe increaſes, and comes nearer and<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65808:111"/>nearer; firſt without doors, afterwards within, which makes him look behind him, and then he ſaw a moſt terrible <hi>Spectre,</hi> in ſhape the ſame as had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him; to wit, a Lean, Meager, Deformed Old Man, with a Long Dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Beard, his Hair ſtanding, an end upon his Head; gives upon his Feet, and Chains in his hands; this Old Gentleman ſtood ſtill, and ſeemed to becken with his finger as if he had called to <hi>Athenodorus. Atheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> anſwers him the ſame way with his hand, intimating to him, that he ſhould ſtay a while, and then goes on writing. But the
<hi>Spectre</hi> ratling his Chains over the Philoſophers Head, obliges him to look up the ſecond time, when ſeeing the <hi>Spectre</hi> ſtill beckning as before, he takes up the Light and follows him; who leads the way, but very ſoftly, as one loaded with Fetters; and at laſt, at a certain place in the <hi>Area</hi> of the Houſe, he Vaniſhes, and leaves
<hi>Athenodorus</hi> alone. <hi>Athenodorus</hi> being thus left, gathers ſome Herbs and Leaves, and what he could ſcrape together, and puts them on the place as a mark; and the next day applying himſelf to the Chief Magiſtrate, acquaints him with the Story, and adviſes that the place ſhould be digged, which being done, there were found the Bones of a Man, and Chains,<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65808:111"/>but the Fleſh entirely Conſumed; they gather the Bones together and bury them, after which the Houſe was Haunted no Longer.</p>
                     <p>The Two former Stories, tho' they are Related by
<hi>Pliny</hi> but upon Tradition, ſeem very Credible, But the Third, which follows, he tells of his own Knowledge. He had, he ſays, a Certain Freed man, whoſe Name was <hi>Marcus,</hi> a Learned Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Perſon. This
<hi>Marcus,</hi> one Time as he was Lying in Bed with his younger Brother, thought, that he ſaw ſomething ſitting on the ſame Bed, that, with a Raſor, Shaved his Head all over; and in the Morning it was found, that Really his Head had been Shaved, the Hairs Lying all about the Place. Not Long after ſays <hi>Pliny,</hi> Another, the Like Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Hapned, that Confirm'd the Former. For a Certain Youth Lying with many others in the Servants Lodgings, there came unto him through the Window, (for ſo the Youth Related the Story) two Perſons in white Tunicks, who, as he Lay, fell to Shaving of him, and having done it, Returned the ſame way they came; and that this was a Reall Thing, and not a Dream only, or only a Fancy between Sleeping and Waking, was Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted (ſays the Author) by the Day, for<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65808:112"/>when this came, it was ſeen that the Youth was Shaved, and that the Hairs lay Scattered about the Bed.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Inſtances that Convinced <hi>Pliny,</hi> a Perſon uſed to Buſineſs, Wiſe, and Circumſpect, not Credulous, or Eaſie to be Impoſed upon, and Abuſed; to which I will Add but one more, but that ſhall be a <hi>recent</hi> one, of our own Time, and well Atteſted: a Story Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Perſon of Quality, and of Great worth; who I believe has more Honour than to ſuffer the World to be Palm'd upon by what He knew a Falſity; and Greater Prudence than to give ſuch a Story a Licenſe without ſome Inquiry after the truth of it. The Story is This,
<q rend="inline">'The 22 of <hi>February,</hi> 1671, we (ſays the Maſter that tells it) Sailed from <hi>Graves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end;</hi> and the
26th, by Gods Providence we Sailed over the Bar of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and there Loaded the 2d. of <hi>March.</hi> About Nine or ten of the Clock in the Night Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, we having made all clear and Ready for the Furtherance of our Voyage, ſome time after Supper I went to Reſt, when about twelve of the Clock in the Night; to the beſt of my Remembrance, I was Awaked out of my Sleep by a Great <hi>Noiſe,</hi> (but ſaw nothing) which to the beſt of my Capacity bid me <hi>Be gone,</hi>
                           <pb n="217" facs="tcp:65808:112"/>and that I had nothing to do there, but being ſo haſtily Diſturbed, and not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what might be the Cauſe, I gave it over for a <hi>Dream,</hi> and paſt that Accident as Uncertain of the Truth. Now after the Firſt Day was Paſt, about Eight or Nine of the Clock at Night I went to reſt; and about Twelve, my Mate was ſtriking a Light to take a Pipe of Tobacco (as I ſuppoſe) and Expecting the Wherry to go up to the Town, being the Tide fell out about Two in the Morning, I deſired the Candle might not be put out, and being as well
<hi>Awake</hi> as now I am, to the beſt of my Remembrance, I was then
<hi>Pulled</hi> by the hair of my head off from my Pillow, and the
<hi>ſame</hi> words Declared unto me as before; and then I <hi>ſaw</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Face and Proportion of a <hi>Man,</hi> in a Black Hat, Stuff-Coat, and Striped Neck-Cloth, with Hanging down hair, and a ſowre Down-looking Countenance, and his Teeth being ſet in his Head, I had then time to ſay, Lord have Mercy upon me, What art? at which he Vaniſhed, yet the Candle Burned very Blew, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt went out: Hereupon being much Diſcontented, I did by the Following Poſt give my owners a juſt Account of what had Befallen me.</q>

I was yet Doubtful of more Wind; and therefore cauſed the Men to furl the Fore Top-ſail, and Lower down the Main Topſail upon the back of the Main ſail, but could not with all the ſtrength we had hale in; the Weather brake off the fore Top-ſail, when this was ſtill in my Judgment, that our Ship did hale as much, as when our ſails were out, then we haled up our Main-ſail, and ſtill the Ship had the ſame Liſt as with a Large Wind, which to my Judgment might be half a ſtreak, or thereabouts.</q>

Neither could I find the Reaſon, being ſtill ſo fair Weather, this unkind ſteerage made me Urgent to try the Pump yet more, but I could not get the upper Box to work, nor ſtir, but having taken that up, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Pump-hook, we could not come near the Lower Box by a foot and half, which to my Judgment was Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by ſomething like a <hi>Bull-fiſh</hi> or Woolſack, that as we forced down, gave up again with the Hook: Whereupon Miſtruſting that all was not well, I cauſed our Men to keep the Coat of our Pump up; and my ſelf Looſned the Tack; in the mean time I ordered two Men to Looſe the Boat, which they did being Laſhed in three Places: yet they do not Remember to this hour, that they Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any of them but the Middlemoſt;<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65808:114"/>and with three Men in her, the Boat <hi>went over</hi> the Top of the Foreſheet, which lay above the ſtem, without Touching it, with ſuch Violence, as even Amazed us that ſaw it; And they that were in the Boat, gave ſuch loud cryes, as frighted him at the Helm, who came Running out unknown to me, but finding the Ship coming nearer the Wind then formerly, I Ran to the Stair-caſe, to bid him put the Helm over, but could not: and hearing one jump down at the Hatch, which was open at the half-deck, did ſuppoſe that the Helms-man came Down again; and calling him by his Name to come and help me, the word was no ſooner out of my Mouth, but I Perceived the <hi>ſame</hi> Perſon that I had formerly ſeen before we came out of the Harbour; who came violently to me, ſaying, be gone, you have no more to do here.

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Apparition of Spirits twofold, Real, or Viſional; both ways Explained. A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit about the Appearing of Ghoſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. That moſt Apparitions of Spirits are Viſional, not Real, Evinced by ſeveral Conſiderations. Some <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Apparitions Salved. Of the Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Spirits.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THIS Laſt Argument for the Real Exiſtence of Spirits taken from their Apparition. Invites me to Conſider the <hi>Ways</hi> in which they uſe to Appear. And There are <hi>two</hi> ways in which they do, or may
<hi>Appear,</hi> the one Real, the other I call Viſional.</p>
                  <p>I call it <hi>Real</hi> Appearing, when they preſent themſelves to ſome of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes, and (particularly to the Eye,) in ſome thing that does Really Affect it; and ſo, by means of the ſenſe, (in the ſame way as all Corporeal External <hi>Objects</hi> do) they Affect and ſtir the <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> I call their Appearing
<hi>Viſional,</hi> when by Affecting or Stiring the <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> they occaſion ſuch Appearances as ſeem External to the <hi>Eye,</hi> or other <hi>ſenſes,</hi>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:65808:116"/>tho' indeed there is nothing that does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affect <hi>it,</hi> or <hi>them,</hi> from without. This Conception is grounded upon comon Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. For few are ignorant that things appear as external to the ſenſe, <hi>not only</hi> when impreſſions are made upon it from without, by real Objects that move it,
<hi>but alſo</hi> when the imagination is ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtricken by ſomething from within, for ſo it is in <hi>Dreams,</hi> in which all things do ſeem as really tranſacted for the time; (and not ſeldom, where the impreſſion is very ſtrong, even after that men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened) as when the External Senſe is affected by Objects.</p>
                  <p>Well then, in real Apparitions of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the external ſenſe is immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected; but in thoſe that are Viſional, the Imagination.</p>
                  <p>The real appearing of Spirits is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally thought to be performed, <hi>either</hi> by their aſſuming of Bodies that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prepared; <hi>or</hi> by Figuring the Air, or ſome other Elementary Subſtance into the ſhapes in which they appear; which latter is done by the
<hi>Plaſtic</hi> Power of the Imagination; a Power a Spirit is believed to have, becauſe we truly experience <hi>ſuch an one</hi> in our incorporated ſelves, not only upon the <hi>Spirits</hi> in the Brain, which are
<hi>Figured</hi> into a Thouſand ſhapes at our<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65808:116"/>pleaſure, in the ſeveral things we do imagine; but in ſome caſes, upon exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bodies; as in the <hi>Signatures</hi> of <hi>the Faetus;</hi> not to mention other leſs certain, but ſtrongly aſſerted inſtances.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, I take the former <hi>Thought</hi> in this Matter, for a much more <hi>probable</hi> one, than that of ſome others; which is, that Spirits do appear by Condenſation of their <hi>Vehicles,</hi> and diſappear by Attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating them; this being not a very eaſie Conception, for of what Matter muſt ſuch Vehicles conſiſt? ay, of <hi>what</hi> vaſt
<hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> muſt the Vehicle of a Spirit be, in its own proportion? if when it is Condenſed and Shrunk ſo much, as it muſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Object of Senſe, it is yet in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion</hi> Equal, and ſometimes Superiour, unto <hi>that</hi> of a Man.</p>
                  <p>Some are of the Opinion, that <hi>Ghoſts</hi> (by which I mean the Apparitions of Souls Departed) do for the moſt part by virtue of their Formative <hi>Plaſtic</hi> Power, frame unto themſelves the Vehicles in which they appear, out of the <hi>Moiſture</hi> of their own deſerted Bodies; this being a Matter that is believed more Congenial to them, and more Sympathetical; and for that Reaſon, they ſay, it is, that Ghoſts do often appear in <hi>Church-Yards;</hi> and that they do not appear but <hi>for ſome ſhort time,</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:65808:117"/>to wit, before the moiſture is wholly dried up; as alſo, that the Ancients uſed to <hi>Burn</hi> not to
<hi>Burie</hi> the Dead; for <hi>Cardan</hi> tells us, that during that Cuſtom, there was no ſuch Appearing of Ghoſts as is now.</p>
                  <p>But this Opinion has very little ground; for beſides, that it does account but for the Apparition of <hi>Souls,</hi> and not that of
<hi>Angels,</hi> good, or bad; tho' it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that Departed Souls, if at any time they appear, they do it the ſame way that Angels are uſed to do, ſince there is the ſame reaſon they ſhould. I ſay beſides this, it is certain (if any Stories of ſuch a nature are certain) that pretended Ghoſts have appeared ſo long after their deceaſe from their ſeveral Bodies, that nothing could remain of theſe but the Duſt; and it is alſo certain, that many Perſons have been <hi>ſeen</hi> (to all Appearances) while alive, in their proper Shapes and Meen, and with the very Cloaths they were uſed to wear; and this could not be done by means of Vehicles framed of their Radical moiſture. In truth, this laſt is a very croſs
<hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all Apparition of Ghoſts uncertain and queſtionable, ſince it ſeems to infer, that it is not the Departed Soul it ſelf that appears, whenever there is ſuch an
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65808:117"/>Apparition, but ſome other Spirit that
<hi>Perſonates</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>For my own part, I ſee many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the way, of the real Apparition of Spirits; for beſides that of the <hi>aſſuming</hi> of Bodies, many times they do Eat and Drink, and perform ſeveral other <hi>Vital Actions,</hi> that ſeem very hard to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in that way; ſo that I am much inclined to believe, (that) their Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſtly, if not only <hi>Viſional;</hi> not by an immediate affection of the External Senſe, but by affecting and ſtriking the Imagination in the way I have mentioned before. And herein I am confirm'd, in that it ſeems to have been the common Sentiment of all the Ancients; who did for this reaſon (as I noted before) call the <hi>Apparitions</hi> of Spirits <hi>Phantaſmata,</hi> or
<hi>Idola;</hi> to wit, becauſe they were rather <hi>Imaginative,</hi> than
<hi>Real,</hi> not as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would carry it, as if they thought that all Spirits were only <hi>Phantaſmata,</hi> or meer Fancies, but becauſe they thought that Spirits uſed not to <hi>Appear</hi> but by affecting and ſtriking the Fancy. And this is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in that they did call Apparitions not only <hi>Phantaſmata,</hi> or Images, but alſo
<hi>Pneumata</hi> or Spirits; by the latter Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſignifying the
<hi>nature</hi> of the things that did appear, as by the former, the
<hi>way</hi> in<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65808:118"/>which they appeared. Thus <hi>Luke,</hi> when he would intimate that the Diſciples (at the time they ſaw our Lord after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection) ſuppoſed that they had ſeen a Spirit, does not uſe the word <hi>Phantaſma,</hi> as the two other Evangeliſts,
<hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> do, on the like occaſion, but the word
<hi>Pneuma,</hi> Luke 24.37. <hi>But they</hi> [the Diſciples] <hi>were terified and frighted, and ſuppoſed they had ſeen a Spirit.</hi> [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.] I add, that from the
<hi>different</hi> Expreſſions that theſe Evangeliſts do uſe, on the like occaſion; <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> expreſſing the ſuppoſed ſeeing of a Spirit, by ſeeing of a <hi>Phantaſm,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,] but <hi>Luke,</hi> by ſeeing of a
<hi>Spirit;</hi> [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,] one may infer, that when they thought the Apparition to be of a <hi>Good Spirit,</hi> they called it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or a
<hi>Spirit;</hi> but when of a <hi>Bad,</hi> they called it
<hi>Phantaſma,</hi> as who would ſay, a <hi>Sprite,</hi> an Hob-Goblin, an illuſion of Devils; without conceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what perhaps ſome others will judge as propable, that they had an Opinion (as, if I do not miſ-remember, the Modern <hi>Platoniſts</hi> had,) that <hi>Good</hi> Spirits did uſe to appear <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>bad</hi> ones, by diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and
<hi>troubling the Fancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Conſideration that induces me to think the Apparition of Spirits to be moſtly (if not always) Viſional, is, that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65808:118"/>all <hi>Appearance</hi> will be the ſame in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Apparitions, upon the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that they are but Viſional, as upon that, that they are real; ſince <hi>Common Dreams,</hi> in thoſe that ſleep; and <hi>waking ones</hi> in the Melancholy, the Maniacal, and the Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, do ſeem as real to them, as any things that are moſt ſo. And as <hi>ſome</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances will equally as well be ſalved upon one <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> as upon the other, ſo there are
<hi>others,</hi> that will be better ſalved upon the Viſional, than on the Real Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis; particularly this, that <hi>Spectres</hi> are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſaid to be ſeen by one Perſon in a Room, that are not by others in the ſame Room, tho' they look where they are ſaid to be ſeen. A Spirit may be eaſily Conceived to affect and ſtrike the <hi>Imagination</hi> of one Perſon, without doing ſo to anothers; but that the ſame <hi>External Object</hi> ſhould be ſeen by one, and not by another that has the ſame advantage, is ſomewhat har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to think, and I had almoſt ſaid, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived without a double Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. In ſhort, one can better conceive how Spirits ſhould eat, and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Viſional, than in the Real Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</p>
                  <p>I know it may be told me, that it is more uſual for Spirits to appear by <hi>Night</hi> than by <hi>Day,</hi> and in <hi>Dark</hi> and Gloomy<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65808:119"/>places, than in open and lightſome; and thoſe who hold the real apparition of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, will think that they can give a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account of this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can, who do believe it but Viſional. For they will ſay; <hi>Thoſe</hi> of them that do hold the Opinion of a Spirits appearing by <hi>Condenſation</hi> of his own Vehicle, that the <hi>Cold</hi> of the Night, as alſo of umbragious and gloomy places, where the Sun does not enter, or of ſolitary uninhabited ones, where Fire is not uſed, does much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Conſpiſſation of the Spirits Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle: And <hi>Thoſe</hi> that hold the Opinion that Spirits appear <hi>by Forming</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Body of Air, will ſay, that the Spiſſitude of the Air, which is greater by Night than by Day (when the preſence of the Sun attenuates it,) and greater in gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and uninhabited, than in lightſom and inhabited places, does make the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a Body (and by conſequence their Apparition) more agreeable and eaſie to them. But what can be ſaid of this appearance in the <hi>Viſional</hi> Hypotheſis.</p>
                  <p>I cannot foreſee how very acceptable, or otherwiſe, ſuch a Diſcourſe as this will be unto others, but to me it is of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect (that is) not very Agreeable. For that the <hi>Angelical Vehicle</hi> ſhould be obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to the impreſſions of Heat and Cold,<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65808:119"/>(as is in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Opinion,) ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a groſs Conception; nor can I ſee how the Spiſſitude, or the Tenuity of the Air ſhould ſignifie much, either to further or to hinder the making a body of Air by a Spirit, (as it is apprehended to do in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Opinion,) if a Spirit be conceived (as he muſt) to work <hi>Magically,</hi> and not
<hi>Mecannically,</hi> in it. But not to inſiſt on this, but to anſwer directly. The Reaſon then why Spirits do appear in the Night rather than in the Day, and in dark gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſolitary places rather than in others, is from the <hi>ſilence</hi> and vacancy that is at ſuch times, and in ſuch places, ſo that the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination not being poſſeſſed, or diverted, by External Objects, is more attentive unto, and Conſequently more ſuſceptive of internal impreſſions; there being the ſame Reaſon for
<hi>this</hi> Phaenomenon, as there is for ſome <hi>others,</hi> to wit, our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hearing a Sound by Night than in the Day, and our ſeeing of the Images in a Darkned Room upon a Paper, or Wall, that Diſappear as ſoon as a greater Light is admitted.</p>
                  <p>By theſe and other Conſiderations, I am more inclined to a belief of the <hi>Viſional,</hi> than of the <hi>Real</hi> Apparition of Spirits; the <hi>Former</hi> being accompanied with fewer Difficulties, and alſo being a thing that is<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65808:120"/>eaſily conceived; for one that thinks, will more eaſily admit an Angel can affect and ſtir the imagination, (which we ſee both many <hi>Diſtempers,</hi> and more
<hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi> can do;) than that it ſhould
<hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> a Body, or aſſume one Created; or in fine, be able to alter its own Vehicle, ſo much from its proper <hi>Dimenſion,</hi> that the ſqueezing of an Elephant into that of a Mouſe, is of no Compariſon with it.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, I ſhould be more inclined than I am to the
<hi>Real Hypotheſis,</hi> if I could believe the <hi>Spagirical Reſurrection</hi> of Plants, or the <hi>Reality</hi> of Apparitions reſembling Men, that are ſaid to be ſeen in Diſtilling-Veſſels, upon the Diſtillation of Human Blood; of which <hi>Peter Borellus</hi> (a Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but too Credulous Author) tells us in his Obſervations,
<hi>Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 62. I fear, with more preſumption, than cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. For my part, I muſt acknowledge my unbelief as to it.</p>
                  <p>I will only add, for the fuller clearing of the Theory of the Apparition of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> that what <hi>Gravity</hi> or weight is in reſpect of Elementary Bodies, That a ſtrong <hi>Inclination</hi> or
<hi>Habit,</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> or Paſſion is unto Souls; and Conſequently, that we ſeldom hear of the Apparition of <hi>Any</hi> but of ſuch as went out of the Body with great <hi>Reluctance;</hi> with a violent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65808:120"/>of <hi>Revenge;</hi> or with a ſtrong
<hi>Deſire</hi> of having ſomething done, that was in their will, but not in their power. And of the appearing of <hi>ſuch</hi> we often hear; but
<hi>whether</hi> the Apparition is of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf, or of its <hi>Repreſentative</hi> only, to wit, ſome <hi>Genius Perſonating</hi> the Deceaſed; and <hi>why</hi> (often times) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears unto Perſons no way concerned, and not to thoſe that are, when it would have ſomething revealed; as <hi>alſo</hi> the Laws of the Spiritual World, (for Laws there muſt be, which do confine and regulate the motions of Spirits;) theſe, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points in the buſineſs of Spirits are all unknown unto me, and perhaps are only known unto God.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now proceed to the <hi>Diſtribution</hi> of Spirits; but this entirely depends upon the Hiſtory of them, and we know but little of that Hiſtory: Beſides, there is in what we are thought to know, ſo much of Tale, Romance, and Invention, that, upon ſtrict inquiry, not one Relation of a hundred holds true, even of their Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; an Obſervation which obliged <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> of old, and <hi>many</hi> now, to Ridicule them all. Wherefore I reſolve to Omit, as a Task too hard for me, to diſcourſe of their <hi>Kinds,</hi> and their <hi>Orders;</hi> only in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65808:121"/>
                     <hi>General,</hi> I will adventure to affirm (if this be to Adventure, to ſay, what few will deny,) that that there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Species;</hi> Angels in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and Devils out of it; and perhaps a <hi>Lower ſort</hi> of Spirits than thoſe we commonly call Devils. But for the <hi>Celeſtial Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi> as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> (the True, or the Falſe) has ſet it out, and the <hi>Diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi> in it, that he makes of <hi>Seraphim,</hi> of <hi>Cherubim,</hi> of <hi>Thrones,</hi> of
<hi>Dominations,</hi> of <hi>Vertues,</hi> of <hi>Powers,</hi> of
<hi>Principalities,</hi> of <hi>Arch-Angels,</hi> and of <hi>Angels;</hi> as alſo of the Politick <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>Orders</hi> that are in <hi>it:</hi> One had need be a Saint, and as illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with Revelation as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> himſelf was, to underſtand the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> and for the <hi>Latter,</hi> he muſt be a Conjurer of the Higheſt Claſs, and poſſibly more than a Conjurer, to have any, or any certain Account of it.

                     <p>The Subject farther Illuſtrated, by a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Univerſe with a particular Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. The Univerſe a whole; Particular Animals but Members of that whole. A Particular Animal is as an Organ with its faculty; the Univerſe, as a Body compoſed of ſeveral Organs, with a Soul that endues theſe Organs with ſeveral Faculties. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration even to ſenſe, of a common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that penetrates throughout the Univerſe. In what ſenſe a Soul is a faculty, and in what a Principle of Faculties. Two ſenſes of the word Soul, and how in both, it may be conceived as a Principle of Faculties. The Soul in its ſtate of ſeparation becomes a Spirit properly. Soul is the name of a part, a Spirit the name of a whole Subſtance. God the Central Sun, and Fountain of all Souls and Spirits. The Emanation of Souls and Spirits from God, or from his Spirit, ſet out in the Compariſon of Light and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Not only Philoſophers, and Poets, but even many Chriſtian Doctors, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> compared God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his influence in and over the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, unto the Soul in a Man.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:65808:122"/>IN the Precedent Chapter, I have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my Reader ſomething concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of <hi>Animals,</hi> as well thoſe that are Inviſible, called <hi>Spirits,</hi> as thoſe that are Viſible; but the ſubject being Obſcure, I think my ſelf obliged to turn it every way, to ſee what further Light may be Given to it; and therefore I will now Enlarge upon <hi>one Point,</hi> in Relation unto it, that I did but touch before, whereby I hope to Illuſtrate it.</p>
                  <p>It is Received on all hands, except by <hi>Carteſians,</hi> that in every viſible <hi>Animal,</hi> as well as in <hi>Man,</hi> there is a Body Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſeveral Organs, and there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faculties or Powers, according to the ſeveral Organs; and there is a Common Principle (called a Soul) that Permeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throughout the Body, doth Furniſh it in its ſeveral Organs with thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faculties.</p>
                  <p>Now, As all the <hi>Organs</hi> of any Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Animal, tho' being Compared <hi>one with Another,</hi> they are <hi>ſeveral,</hi> not Parts one of Another, but a kind of wholes, and have their ſeveral Faculties; yet in reſpect of the <hi>Body,</hi> they are but <hi>Parts,</hi> and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by a <hi>Common Principle,</hi> which giveth being to <hi>its</hi> ſeveral Faculties, but is none of them it ſelf. Why may not
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65808:123"/>all the <hi>Animals,</hi> themſelves (as well the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible as the Viſible,) that do Exiſt in the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> be, in reſpect of <hi>this</hi> but as ſo many <hi>Parts,</hi> ſo many Organs, (ſome more Simple, others more Compound) Actuated by ſome
<hi>Common Principle</hi> that Penetrates throughout <hi>it;</hi> and yet, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <hi>one of Another,</hi> be ſeveral <hi>wholes,</hi> that have their ſeveral Powers and Faculties? And then, <hi>as</hi> all the Particular Animals would, in truth, be but as ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Organs Endued with ſeveral Faculties, in which the Organ or Syſtem of Organs would be the
<hi>Body,</hi> the Faculty or Syſtem of Faculties the <hi>Soul; ſo</hi> all of them taken together, would be an Entire Body [of the <hi>Univerſe</hi>] Actuated by an Univerſal Principle, (as by a Common Soul) that ſhould Endow it with thoſe ſeveral Powers and Faculties. In ſhort; why may not the Univerſe Really be Body and Soul, and every Particular Animal (as a part thereof) be Organ and Faculty, in the ſame ſenſe that in our ordinary Common way of Conceiving, every Particular Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is Body and Soul, and the Parts of it, Organs and Faculties? But to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>This is Certain, that what in Animals, and particularly in a Man, we do Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65808:123"/>call a <hi>Faculty,</hi> is neither that which commonly is called the Soul, nor is it meerly the Body, or any Part of the Body, but a <hi>Reſult;</hi> ſome Third thing Ariſing from them both in Conjunction. For the <hi>Eye,</hi> for Example, tho' never ſo well Qualified, doth not ſee, unleſs the Mind or Soul do Attend; and again, the
<hi>mind</hi> or Soul, tho' never ſo Attentive, cannot ſee, unleſs it has the uſe of an Eye, to ſee with; ſo that the <hi>Power</hi> of ſeeing neither is in the Eye barely, nor in the Soul barely, but belongs to the
<hi>Animal,</hi> which is Soul and Body: as ariſing from the preſence of the Soul in ſuch a Particular Part, or Organ, of the Body. And the like is to be ſaid of other Powers.</p>
                  <p>And yet if all the Faculties that are united in Man, were ſuppoſed <hi>Separated</hi> each from other, <hi>with</hi> their ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and ſo to be in the Nature of <hi>wholes,</hi> and this without the ſuppoſal of any Thing elſe; for Example, that the <hi>Eye</hi> could ſee apart, the <hi>Ear</hi> hear apart, and the <hi>Tongue</hi> taſte apart from the Body; there would, to all Appearance, be ſo <hi>many</hi> ſeveral Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and Conſequently ſo many ſeveral Souls: So that what is called a <hi>Faculty</hi> only, while it is in a part, is Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated a
<hi>Soul,</hi> in the whole; and then, where the Body is a Compage, or Syſtem
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65808:124"/>of Organs, the Soul muſt be a <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Faculties: and yet be <hi>one</hi> ſtill, in the ſame ſenſe as the Body is.</p>
                  <p>But here I muſt expect it <hi>ſhall be told</hi> me, that the True and commonly Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Notion of a Soul is, that it is the
<hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of the Faculties called Vital and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and not any one of them it ſelf, or any Syſtem of them All: To which I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> that this is indeed the <hi>Popular</hi> and Common Notion, but how true it is, and how much Adjuſted to the Nature of the Soul, cannot be underſtood but by making ſome Diſtinction in the ſenſe of word [Soul.]</p>
                  <p>The word [Soul] may be taken <hi>Two ways,</hi> the one of which I will call the <hi>Philoſophical,</hi> the other the <hi>Popular</hi> ſenſe of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, word [Soul] may be taken
<hi>Philoſophically,</hi> as a Name of <hi>all</hi> the Cauſes together, that are neceſſary for the Producing of Vital and Animal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the ſeveral Species of Animals: and ſo, tho' it is commonly conſidered as if it were ſome <hi>Subſtantial thing,</hi> that Differ'd from them All, yet
<hi>indeed</hi> it is nothing but a <hi>Modification</hi> of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they are All in Conjunction. And <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> who Affirmed there was no
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65808:124"/>ſuch thing as a Soul, if he meant but thus, was very Excuſable; for in this ſenſe, a Soul is nothing but a <hi>Reſult,</hi> that is, a <hi>Mode of Conceiving</hi> (for this I mean by Reſult) of all the
<hi>Cauſes</hi> that muſt be Joyned for Animal, or Vital Actions, as
<hi>they</hi> do either <hi>Qualifie,</hi> or elſe <hi>Aid,</hi> each others Influence. And in this ſenſe, as a <hi>Soul,</hi> in reſpect of the
<hi>Action,</hi> of a Particular Organ, may be called a <hi>Faculty;</hi> ſo in reſpect of the whole <hi>Body,</hi> a <hi>Soul,</hi> is a
<hi>Syſtem</hi> of Faculties. Thus <hi>Life</hi> in Animals, ariſes from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of many things; which things therefore, in that
<hi>Concurrence,</hi> as they are the <hi>Prince</hi> of Life, ſo they may be called the <hi>Soul;</hi> [for by <hi>Soul,</hi> is meant nothing, but the Principle of that, we call the Life;] if one of theſe is wanting (that are neceſſary,) the Life ceaſes, and we ſay, the Soul is <hi>gone;</hi> but then again, (ſuppoſing all the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites Remaining as they ought to be, and Ready to do their Parts,) if that <hi>one,</hi> which was wanting is Reſtored, there is again a Concurrence of <hi>all</hi> the Cauſes Requiſite to Life, and ſo, with the Life, the Soul is ſaid to
<hi>Return,</hi> or come again. For Example, there is in Snakes, in Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice, in Swallows, and in other <hi>Dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Creatures</hi> of that kind, and (if we<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65808:125"/>ſhall believe <hi>Guagninus, apud Schottum,</hi> Phyſ. Curioſ. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 38. §. 4.) in ſome <hi>Men</hi> too, (for ſo he ſays of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of
<hi>Lucomoria,</hi> a certain Country of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> that there is) an Actual Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Exerciſe of Life in all the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of it during Winter, while their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits lie Congealed and un-active; ſo that tho' all the Organs of thoſe Animals, in other Reſpects, are duly Qualified and Diſpoſed, yet there being not, for that ſeaſon, ſufficient Heat Imparted to them from the Sun, to put their <hi>Spirits</hi> in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Theſe,</hi> like <hi>Mercury</hi> while Cold, are wholly un active, and ſo for ſeveral Months there is a Ceſſation of Life (for Life is a Sort of Action) in all the ſenſible Inſtances of it. But then again on the other ſide, nothing being wanting but a due <hi>Heat,</hi> (as unto
<hi>Mercury,</hi> to put it in Actual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) as ſoon as the Sun Returns, and with its warmth, Communicates that Motion that is Requiſite to the Spirits, and other Parts, for the Invigorating, and the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them, there Reſults that Action, or Exerciſe of Organs, which <hi>we</hi> call
<hi>Life,</hi> and which in many Places of Holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is called the <hi>Soul,</hi> tho' <hi>commonly</hi> we call the Soul the
<hi>Principle,</hi> not the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of Life; but then by a Principle we muſt mean the Concourſe of all the Requiſite
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65808:125"/>Cauſes, and ſo the Soul in Effect will be but a
<hi>Faculty,</hi> or rather a Syſtem of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. And ſo much for the
<hi>Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Senſe</hi> of the Word Soul.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the <hi>Former,</hi> there is Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning of the word [Soul], which I call the <hi>Popular,</hi> becauſe it is the moſt uſual, and that is, when it is Taken not for <hi>all</hi> the Cauſes together, or the Reſult of them, as in the Former, but for the
<hi>Principal</hi> and Chief Cauſe of Animal and Vital Actions, which in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is called the <hi>Spirit;</hi> [<hi>who knoweth the Spirit of a Man that goeth Upward, or the Spirit of a Beaſt that goeth Downward?</hi>] And ſo when a Perſon dies, he is ſaid to to give up his Spirit, to Give up the Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>And thus a Soul may be Conceived, a Syſtem of very ſubtle Refined <hi>Matter,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Light,</hi> (but in ſome more, in others leſs Refined) that gives the laſt Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Body and its Organs for the receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Vital <hi>Cogitative Influence,</hi> from the Original Mind; it is the <hi>Texture</hi> and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the
<hi>Body,</hi> and the Organs that compoſe it, that is the Ligament and
<hi>Bond</hi> of union between this ſubtle Matter or Spirit, and
<hi>That;</hi> but it is the <hi>Subtle Matter</hi> or Spirit that is the
<hi>Vinculum</hi> or Bond of Union between the Body and the <hi>Original Mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:65808:126"/>In this way of Conceiving; This Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of Subtle Matter while it is in the Body, tho' it is called a
<hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe of its ſubtlety, in truth, may be but a
<hi>Soul,</hi> that is, a <hi>Means</hi> only of Conveying the Vital Influence into the Body, from the Original Mind; but then again, out of the Body, as the Syſtem of it may be, it may become a <hi>Spirit</hi> properly ſo called; it being then no longer a Part, (as a Soul muſt (be), which is only a Mediate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,) but a whole, and ſo a Terminative Subject, of the Influence of the Original Mind: in ſhort, it becomes a <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> or Subſiſtent by it ſelf. That the Soul is but a Mediate Subject while it is in the Body, and not a Terminative, ſo that properly the <hi>Animal,</hi> (which is Soul and Body,) and not the Soul only, is Agent in all that Paſſes, ſeems Probable, in that all the Ordinary <hi>Actions</hi> of the Man, that commonly are ſaid to be the Souls, are plainly <hi>Organical;</hi> nothing can be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in, as Proceeding from the Soul while it is in the Body, that is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Animal:</hi> even <hi>Intellection</hi> it ſelf, is not an Action only of the Soul, or <hi>Anima,</hi> but (as the <hi>Latins</hi> would Expreſs it,) an Action of the <hi>Animus</hi> or Underſtanding;
<hi>which</hi> is to be Conceived as an Animal and Organical Faculty, that is, as a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65808:126"/>Principally, but not only, from the Soul: for ſo does <hi>Cotta</hi> Diſtinguiſh, <hi>apud Cicerol.</hi> 3.
<hi>de nat. Deor.</hi> when he ſays, <hi>Probabilius videtur tale quiddam eſſe</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, <hi>ut ſit ex Igne, atque Anima temperatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, the <hi>Ordinary</hi> way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving is much
<hi>otherwiſe,</hi> for the <hi>Soul</hi> is Conſidered by the
<hi>Moſt,</hi> as if it were an <hi>Angel</hi> or Spirit, that only dwelt in the Body as in a Houſe; and thus the Soul is the <hi>man,</hi> the Body but as a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> or a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it: nor is this a meer
<hi>Platonical</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is Conformable to the way of
<hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the Holy Scriptures; as, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>I Deſire to be Diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt;</hi> Alſo, where he tells the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>we know if our Earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were Diſſolved,</hi> &amp;c. And for certain, if the Theory of the <hi>Pre-exiſtence</hi> of Souls is a True one, this Opinion is beyond diſpute. However, I will not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in this matter ſince the Language of the Scripture is often Adapted but to the Conceptions of the Vulgar, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be the Standard of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Truth; and it is certain, that even in our Saviours time a many <hi>Pythagorean</hi> and <hi>Platonical Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the Pre-exiſtence of Souls, and the Souls being the Man, had obtained to be Vulgar among the
<hi>Jews;</hi> As appears by<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65808:127"/>that Queſtion of the
<hi>Diſciples,</hi> which they put to our Lord, <hi>was this Man</hi> Born
<hi>Blind for his own;</hi> or for <hi>his Parents ſin?</hi> for it ſuppoſes, that the Man might ſin, and therefore alſo ſuppoſes that he <hi>was,</hi> before he was Born, for he could not Sin, if he was not (in Being.) Beſides, the <hi>Geneſis</hi> or way of Generation of Animals, ſeems to Favour the former opinion more than the latter; for in the latter Opinion, the Soul is conceived as an <hi>Aſſiſtant,</hi> rather than an Informing <hi>Form,</hi> and ſo rather as an <hi>Animal,</hi> than as a
<hi>Part</hi> of one: which doth not ſo well conſiſt with the Method of Generation. In fine, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between <hi>Souls</hi> and
<hi>Abſtract Spirits,</hi> as to their Natures, cannot be ſet out with that Diſtinctneſs and clearneſs in the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as in the Former Opinion.</p>
                  <p>But Take it either way; if we Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Faculties,</hi> and do hold, that Animal <hi>Actions</hi> are the Effects of Faculties, but that the Soul is the Principal cauſe of thoſe Faculties; why may it not be Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (as I Hinted before) that the
<hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirit</hi> is, unto all the <hi>Bodies</hi> in the Univerſe, (thoſe of Invinſible, as well as of Viſible Animals) what the Soul Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of, after this manner, is in our ſelves unto <hi>ours?</hi> So that All particular Animals in reſpect of the Univerſe, ſhould
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65808:127"/>be but as the ſeveral Organs in any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Animal; and then Particular <hi>Souls</hi> ſhould be but as ſo many <hi>Portions of the ſubtle Matter,</hi> through which, and by means of which, the
<hi>Moſaical</hi> Spirit (as a <hi>Soul of the Univerſe</hi>) ſhould Radiate into the ſeveral Bodies, and give them their <hi>Faculties.</hi> In ſhort, we may conceive particular Souls as ſo many <hi>Animi</hi> (for now I Diſtinguiſh, as <hi>Cotta</hi> do's, between <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and
<hi>Anima;</hi>) and that the <hi>Anima,</hi> that is the Sourſe of All theſe <hi>Animi,</hi> is but one, throughout the Univerſe. Why may not this be ſo? And if it may, it muſt, ſince then, the being of Subordinate
<hi>Anima</hi> (other than <hi>Animi</hi>) would be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and unneceſſary; and Beings are not to be Multiplied but on Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there is Reaſon to think there is but <hi>one Soul</hi> Diffus'd throughout the Univerſe, if it be Allowable to make the ſame Judgment in Reference to the whole, that, upon good Conſiderations, may be Framed of the Parts which come Diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within our View. For in this <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial World,</hi> as to the ſeveral <hi>Regions</hi> of it, the Animal, the Vegetable, and the Mineral, it is as certain, that all had but one <hi>Plaſtic,</hi> as that the Body of a Man, or any other particular Animal, had not<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65808:128"/>more. The Evidence is the ſame for Both. There is a ſenſible <hi>Analogy</hi> and Correſpondence in
<hi>Fabric</hi> and Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only between the ſeveral
<hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> (which is very manifeſt in
<hi>Comparative Anatomy;</hi> but alſo, in a good degree, between
<hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Animals,</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> and
<hi>Plants.</hi> Again, there is a like <hi>Connexion</hi> between the
<hi>Beings</hi> that fill thoſe ſeveral Regions, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
<hi>Parts</hi> that compoſe particular Animals; There are no
<hi>Vacuities,</hi> or Gaps in <hi>Nature,</hi> in reſpect of
<hi>Species,</hi> no Jumps or Leaps, but all in orderly <hi>Gradation:</hi> Extreams are Knit and United by <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> that partake of Both; and all is <hi>full,</hi> without any Chaſms. Thus (to touch it in an Example)
<hi>Minerals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables</hi> are Joyned by <hi>Lithodendra</hi> or Stone-Plants, ſuch as Coral and the like; <hi>Vegetables</hi> and
<hi>Animals</hi> by <hi>Zoophytes</hi> or Plantanimals, ſuch as the ſenſible Plant, the Scythian Lamb, and the like. And in the <hi>General Kinds</hi> of Animals, between <hi>Fowls</hi> and <hi>Beaſts,</hi> the
<hi>Bat;</hi> between <hi>Fiſhes</hi> and <hi>Fowls,</hi> the <hi>Flying Fiſh;</hi> between <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> and <hi>Aquatic</hi> Animals, thoſe that are called <hi>Amphibious,</hi> are Middle <hi>Uniting Species,</hi> &amp;c. Farther, there is a <hi>Conformity</hi> in their
<hi>Origination,</hi> as well as in their Structure and Fabrick; for Plants as well as Animals are Produced<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65808:128"/>by <hi>Semination;</hi> and even Minerals and Mettals have their <hi>Matrices;</hi> and tho' they have not what is properly called <hi>Seed,</hi> they have ſomething that is Analogous in their Production. In fine, the <hi>Tranſmutation</hi> of things, and the Eaſie Tranſition of them from one Region unto Another, evinces it. The
<hi>Tranſmutation</hi> of Earthly and Aqueous Bodies into
<hi>Vegetables,</hi> is ſo Obvious, as I need not to Inſtance;
<hi>That</hi> of Vegetables into <hi>Animal Concretes</hi> is as certain, tho' not ſo Obvious and Uſual. The Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Horſe-hairs</hi> that fall into Pools in the Summer time, may be an Example; but thoſe are more Adequate, that are Given in the Generation of <hi>Barnacles;</hi> and in the Animation of the Branches of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Trees.</hi> I Vouch not theſe Inſtances upon uncertain Report (tho' ſome will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it no other,) but on the credit of a Perſon Grave and Unſuſpected, I mean the Excellent
<hi>Schottus,</hi> who in his <hi>Phyſica Curioſa,</hi> l. 1. C. 20. among other Examples very pertinent to this purpoſe, relates thoſe I have mentioned, on his own Knowledge. <hi>Pili,</hi> (ſays he, <hi>è caudis equorum in aquam pluviam, foſſis ac ſcrobibus exceptam deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes Animantur, &amp; in graciles ac Longos vermes inſtar Serpentum convertuntur, ut ipſemet non ſemel vidi.

                  <p>Now, ſo much <hi>Uniformity</hi> even in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; ſuch
<hi>Connexion;</hi> and ſo Eaſie <hi>Tranſition</hi> from one Region into Another, cannot be conceived to be in the World, without conceiving at the ſame time, that as it had but <hi>one Author</hi> or common Plaſtic at firſt; ſo ſtill it has but <hi>one Principle,</hi> that hath the ordering, the Diſpoſing the Framing and Actuating of it, in all its Parts.</p>
                  <p>But to make it more Conceivable, that <hi>all</hi> Particular Beings may be Animated by but <hi>One,</hi> and yet being ſuch Diverſity as they are, let us conſider that Glorious thing we call <hi>Light,</hi> which as it Proceeds and Iſſues from the Sun, is of <hi>one</hi> Nature, but meeting with divers <hi>Objects,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Different
<hi>Modifications,</hi> according to thoſe of the Objects it meets with, is varied into a <hi>Thouſand Colours,</hi> of Different Natures from the Light, as well as one from Another. And it is even thus with the <hi>Vital Energy,</hi> or Light that flows from God (the Intellectual <hi>Sun</hi> and Father of Spirits,) for <hi>This,</hi> tho' as it Proceeds and flows from him, it is but of one Nature, yet, according to the Bodies it meets with,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65808:129"/>(it) becomes Diverſified and Varied, into a Thouſand ſhall I ſay? or rather into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>Faculties</hi> and Powers, that, in their particular Natures, are as Different from the Original Vital Energy it ſelf, (taken in it ſelf,) as All are one from Another. In ſhort, the firſt Subject of Vital Energy is the <hi>Moſaical Spirit;</hi> but This, as it is Received in Bodies of ſeveral Fabricks, Diſpoſitions and Textures, (as well in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as in Inviſible Animals,) become
<hi>Diverſified</hi> into ſeveral Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or (which is the ſame in Effect,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in <hi>Each</hi> a <hi>Principle</hi> of Actions that Differ one from Another, as much as the <hi>Bodies</hi> do that Inveſt it, and as the <hi>Motions,</hi> that, by means of thoſe Bodies, do Affect and Modifie it. Modifications of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative Faculties, or of the Immediate Principle that makes the Being Cogitative, are called <hi>Ideas,</hi> or
<hi>Images,</hi> and are the ſame unto the Mind, in the <hi>Senſe,</hi> and the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> that Senſible <hi>Species</hi> (as they commonly are called) are unto the Light in the Air: for as <hi>Theſe</hi> are nothing but Modification of the Light, ſo <hi>Thoſe</hi> are of the Mind.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Several Objections againſt the Former Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis conſidered, Firſt, that it makes Souls to be Faculties or Powers, whereas indeed they are Actions, or Acts. This Objection Anſwered, and the notion of the Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Principle and Faculty, rather than an Action, cleared. The Second Objection, that in this Hypotheſis the Deity is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an Immanent, and not (what he is) as a Tranſient cauſe of all things, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and how he is both the one and the other, ſhewed, and Confirmed by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and other Chriſtian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; as well as of the Chiefeſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. The Third Objection, that hereby God and Nature are Confounded; Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſhewing how God and Nature are Diſtinguiſhed in this Hypotheſis. The Laſt and ſtrongeſt Objection, that if there were but one Original Perceptive Principle throughout the Univerſe, all Animals would have the ſame Perceptions, which they have not.

                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:65808:130"/>THO' I have Endeavoured to Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Objections in the Diſcourſe that I have made, all along as I made it, yet, to give them a farther clearing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by elucidate more fully the
<hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that I Eſpouſe, this Section ſhall be Employed in propoſing in expreſs Terms, ſuch <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> as do lye againſt it, and in giving them the neceſſary Anſwers.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt <hi>Objection</hi> againſt this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis is, that it ſpeaks of Souls as of <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or</hi> Powers, and not as of things that are Eſſentially <hi>Active;</hi> whereas a Soul is a
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> a Cogitation; or at leaſt a thing that is always Buſie and Doing; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that even in ſleep it does not all Reſt, but that Men do always Dream when they ſleep, tho' perhaps they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſenſible, that they do.</p>
                  <p>I know not how truly it is ſaid, that the Soul is always Buſie, and that Men do always <hi>Dream</hi> when they ſleep; but I could wiſh they did only Dream at that Time; for then we ſhould not be Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſo many Groundleſs Fantaſtick Opinions. But to come nearer the Matter, I know a perſon who Affirms, that, to his Knowledge, he
<hi>never</hi> Dreamt in his whole Life; and certainly, ſince we are
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65808:131"/>always <hi>Conſcious</hi> that we Dream, when ever we do, we ought to believe we have not Dreamed at all, when we are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible we have. Beſides, <hi>how</hi> do they know that the Soul is always Doing? for my part, I am much miſtaken if I do not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in my ſelf (what I think any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may) that I am able to <hi>ſuſpend</hi> all Thought, or (as we commonly Expreſs it) think of nothing. To be ſure, every one who hath made the Leaſt Reflexion muſt needs know, that as we have Eyes, and Ears, and other ſenſitive Organs, and ſo do ſee, and hear, and are Conſcious of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sentiments, in Caſe our Eyes and Ears and thoſe other Organs which we have, are Impreſſed by External Objects; ſo (ordinarily) we do neither ſee, nor Hear, or are Conſcious of any other ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any External <hi>Objects,</hi> if <hi>theſe</hi> do not Affect our Organs: without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Objects we are only ſaid to have the <hi>Faculties</hi> or Powers, that is, we are ſaid, only to be
<hi>Able</hi> to ſee, to Hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but upon the preſence of Objects, and the Application of our Faculties or Powers, we are ſaid to have the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of them, and actually to See and Hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus it is in the External <hi>Senſe.</hi> Now, ſince the <hi>Mind</hi> or Underſtanding is an Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal thing as well as the External ſenſe, I
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65808:131"/>ſee no Reaſon to think, but that as there is no Actual Senſation but when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the ſenſe are ſtirred, ſo there is no Actual Intellection but when that of the Underſtanding is; and that tho' we have always the Power of Underſtanding, as we have that of ſeeing, yet we do not actually Exerciſe that Power, but when it is
<hi>drawn into Act,</hi> by ſome Impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, either from the
<hi>Will</hi> within, or from <hi>Objects</hi> without; any more than we do Actually ſee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when the Eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Affected. In fine, ſince nothing of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation is done within us by the Soul
<hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,</hi> but only by <hi>means</hi> of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or of the will, or of the ſenſe, External, or Internal, and All theſe are rather Faculties than Actions, I believe I have Reaſon to Conclude, that the Soul is rather a Syſtem of the Faculties, or elſe a Principle of them, than that it is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual never ceaſing Exerciſe or Action, It is rather
<hi>Actus,</hi> than <hi>Actio,</hi> in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Schools. And tho' in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of theſe, it be Eſſentially an Act, <hi>Actus Corporis,</hi> an Informing <hi>form</hi> to the Body, yet, in other Reſpects it is but <hi>Actus Primus,</hi> not <hi>Actus Secundus;</hi> for tho' it be an Original Principle of Action, and ſo an Active Power, yet, in it ſelf, it is but a Power, and not Actually Active, or<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65808:132"/>Acting, but in the Requiſite Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thus we are Obliged to ſpeak, to wit,
<hi>inadequately,</hi> in the Notions of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> or Faculties and Exerciſe. And thus much for the Firſt Objection.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, that in this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> in the laſt Reſult, God is made the <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> cauſe, whereas Really, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth of Revelation, Gen. 1. he is only a
<hi>Tranſient</hi> Cauſe of all things. But to this the <hi>Anſwer</hi> is Eaſie; for tho' in Gen. 1. God is Repreſented (as he is in Reality) to be the Almighty Creator of all, and ſo as a Tranſient Cauſe, yet in this ſenſe, he is alſo the <hi>Immanent,</hi> that, by the Moſaical Spirit, he giveth Life and Being, and Motion unto all; and this according to the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> who ſays, that <hi>in him</hi> we live, and move, and have our being; as well as to Common <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> which tell us, that all Beings are either Firſt, or ſecond Beings; and that Second Beings are <hi>Participations</hi> of the Firſt. And however ſtrange it may Look now, it was certainly of Old, the Common ſentiment of all the Wiſer part of the World; the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, as well as Gentile
<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and even of many <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> of the Chriſtian Church; it would be Superfluous, as well as Tedious, to mention all (if I could,) and therefore to<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65808:132"/>confine my ſelf within Fitting Bounds, I will inſtance two or three of the Chief for Examples.

<hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>Sicut Deus in Majori Mundo, ſic Anima in Minori;</hi> as God is in the greater World, ſo is the Soul in the leſſer: and then by a ſimple Converſion of the Sentences, what the Soul is in the leſſer World (of Man,)<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65808:133"/>that God muſt be in the greater; and this he ſays is according to St. <hi>Auguſtine, ſicut enim</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Deus eſt in Majori Mundo, ſic Anima in Minori, viz. in homine, ſecundum Auguſtinum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only here it muſt be obſerved, that when <hi>God</hi> is compared unto a <hi>Soul,</hi> it muſt be underſtood with due limitation; to wit, as a Soul is taken only for a <hi>Principle</hi> of Powers and Actions, and not as it is an informing <hi>Form,</hi> or part of the Animal; for that God ſhould be a Soul in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe, is a notion no ways agreeing to him, who, in himſelf is all, and only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Objection</hi> is, that <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> are confounded in this Hypotheſis, ſo that it is not eaſie to ſay what is the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>God</hi> in things, and what is
<hi>Natures,</hi> or how they differ; to which I <hi>Reply,</hi> that indeed in the Holy Scriptures all is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God, and the Spirit of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of Nature; and yet ſince there are ſecond Cauſes, as well as a firſt, and ſo there is a thing which we call <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> (for by this I now mean nothing but <hi>ſecond Cauſes</hi> and their working;) it will be very convenient to ſhow <hi>how</hi> God, how Nature does operate, and how they differ: and <hi>this</hi> perhaps may be done upon the propoſed
<hi>Hypotheſis</hi> better than on any<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65808:134"/>other. For in
<hi>this,</hi> God and Nature are diſtinguiſhed, as the Soul of an Animal, and the Syſtem of Faculties; taking the Soul (as it is in the common Opinion) for the Principle of Faculties, and Faculties for the immediate Principles of all actions of Animals; and thus <hi>Active Nature</hi> is the Syſtem of all the Powers, all the Faculties of the Univerſe, and <hi>God</hi> the eſſential Principle of them. Or more plainly, ſince Faculties and Principles are notions rather than things, and ſome will be apt enough, without conſidering their grounds, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them only as meer notions, I ſhall therefore ſet out the difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, in more Real Expreſſions, by ſaying, that the <hi>Influence</hi> of God, or his active preſence in things by means of the Moſaical Spirit, is as <hi>Light,</hi> and that <hi>Nature,</hi> (the Syſtem of all the Powers in the Univerſe) is as a Complex of all <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;</hi> ſo that as Colour is the Modification of Light, and Light the eſſence of Colour, ſo particular Powers and Actions (that are but Powers in act,) are Modifications of the Divine Energy, and the Divine Energy the ſubſtance both of the Act and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and thus the influence of the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Cauſes differ, as <hi>Motion,</hi> and <hi>Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of Motion; the Motion ariſes from the <hi>firſt,</hi> the Modification from the <hi>ſecond</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:65808:134"/>Cauſe, either as it is an <hi>Organ,</hi> or as an
<hi>Object:</hi> and ſo too, the <hi>Aberrations</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Monſters, and in other inſtances, are accounted for, either by the ill Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Organs, the over-whelming of matter, or by ſome other vitioſity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the ſecond Cauſes, without any impeachment of the firſt. As the ſcriblings of a bad miſhaping Pen, are not imputed to the hand that guides it, which perhaps may be skilful enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that depraves the motion; and this, tho' the Motion comes from the Writer. In fine, I do not ſee any reaſon why <hi>vital</hi> Energy may not be <hi>Imparted</hi> and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, as well as <hi>Local,</hi> which our ſenſe evinces to be ſo: one Body that is in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtriking another that is not, thereby <hi>Communicates</hi> its Motion to it; and
<hi>thus</hi> a Cogitative vital <hi>Energy</hi> may <hi>come</hi> from God, and being <hi>diffuſed</hi> as Light is throughout the Univerſe, may be catched by agreeable Organs, and <hi>Modified</hi> by Objects, in the way that I have ſhewed before. I only hint this by way of Anticipation, to ſuch as will inquire, whether this Cogitative vital Energy, diffus'd throughout the World, be <hi>God</hi> himſelf or no, or what it is; for there I ſtick, and call in the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and united force of greater under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, mine beginning to be dazled<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65808:135"/>with the luſtre, or the ſubtilty of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: as yet I take it to be the <hi>Moſaical Spirit.</hi> So much for this <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> I ſhall propoſe is the Herculean one, that is inſiſted upon by many Great and very Judicious Men, which is, that if there is <hi>but one</hi> Original Perceptive throughout the Univerſe, all Animals would have the <hi>ſame</hi> Perceptions, ſo that what is known by
<hi>one,</hi> could be ignored by <hi>none;</hi> ay, the ſame ſentiments, the ſame Reſentments, the ſame Pains, the ſame pleaſures, that are in
<hi>any</hi> one, would be in <hi>every</hi> one; and there could be no
<hi>Numerication,</hi> no individuation of Spirits, or Souls, becauſe <hi>no ſeparate,</hi> particular Perceptions.</p>
                  <p>But this Objection as it is greater in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance than in reality, ſo it can have little effect, if we conſider, that it does equally deſtroy the <hi>diverſity</hi> of Perceptions in the ſeveral Organs and Parts of <hi>one</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, which yet our own Experience at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts unto, as
<hi>that</hi> of the perceptions of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral</hi> Animals in the Univerſe; ſince, as there is but one Original Perceptive throughout the Univerſe, in the propoſed Opinion; ſo in the common, there is but one in every Animal; and yet, tho' the <hi>Soul</hi> is but <hi>one,</hi> the
<hi>Faculties</hi> are <hi>many,</hi> and the <hi>exerciſes</hi> of them
<hi>ſeveral.</hi> For if but<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65808:135"/>
                     <hi>one</hi> Eye is inflamed, the ſenſe of Pain is <hi>not</hi> in <hi>both;</hi> and when but one Arm, or one Hand is wounded, the ſmart thereof is <hi>only</hi> in one; ay, the pains and ailments of the <hi>Superior</hi> Parts, are not felt in the
<hi>Inferior,</hi> nor the ſufferances of <hi>theſe</hi> in
<hi>thoſe;</hi> ſo that though the Animal it ſelf may be ſaid to have the Perception of all thoſe of its ſeveral parts, yet theſe cannot be truly ſaid to have one anothers. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that as the Soul may be ſaid to have a common ſenſe of all perceptions, but the ſeveral Members, each to have but a private ſenſe for it ſelf; ſo anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, tho' the <hi>Original Perceptive</hi> is ſenſible of
<hi>all,</hi> (and needs muſt, for he that made the Eye muſt needs ſee, and he that plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Ear, muſt needs hear; and he that gave an heart unto man muſt needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,) yet <hi>Particular Percipients,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Animals, as ſo many particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans muſt have <hi>but</hi> their ſhare: one Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal can no more pretend to have the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of another, (tho' the Original per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive is the ſame in both, and is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the perceptions of both) than in the ſame Animal the
<hi>Eye</hi> can pretend to <hi>Hear,</hi> or the <hi>Ear</hi> to <hi>See,</hi> or either of them to <hi>Smell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is evident, that the <hi>Individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and Numerication of <hi>Perceptions,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65808:136"/>of Perceptive <hi>Powers,</hi> ariſes from the <hi>Bodies,</hi> or Organs, by means of which ſuch perceptions are made; for where the
<hi>Bodies</hi> are <hi>ſeparated,</hi> or the Organs <hi>diſtinct,</hi> there the <hi>Perceptions</hi> made in thoſe Bodies, and by means of ſuch Organs are likewiſe <hi>ſo.</hi> In ſhort, as I hinted before, percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perceptive powers are individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Bodies,</hi> in the ſame ways as <hi>Images</hi> are by <hi>Looking-Glaſſes,</hi> or
<hi>Eccho's</hi> by the contrivance of <hi>Objects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to demonſtrate it in <hi>Experience,</hi> as well as by diſcourſe, I will add a Hiſtory or two of Monſters, that will do it plainly. The firſt ſhall be out of <hi>Trivet,</hi> and in his own Terms, (as I read them in an Ancient Manuſcript) who reports the Accident juſt as

                  <p>I will not give my ſelf the trouble to tranſlate the Relation, becauſe I find it in Mr. <hi>Roſs</hi> his continuation of Sir
<hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s Hiſtory of the World, who thus tells the Story,
<hi>ad An.</hi> 1490. About this time (ſays he) a ſtrange Monſter was born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which <hi>beneath</hi> the Navel was <hi>one</hi> Body, but <hi>above, two</hi> diſtinct Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, having <hi>different Senſes,</hi> Souls, and Wills; any hurt <hi>beneath</hi> the Navel is equally felt by <hi>Both</hi> Bodies above, but if any of the <hi>upper</hi> Members were hurt, <hi>one</hi> of the Bodies <hi>only</hi> felt the pain.

                  <p>I might inſtance in many other Stories of this kind, but theſe ſuffice to evince what I induce them for, that the
<hi>numerica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Souls, and conſequently of other Spirits, depends upon <hi>that</hi> of Bodies; for in the alledged Examples, eſpecially the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is plain, that where the <hi>Bodies</hi>

<hi>likewiſe were;</hi> ſo that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of but one, were not felt by both, but by one only; and yet again, in the parts beneath the Navel, common unto both the Bodies, any hurts in theſe were equally perceived by both.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Subſtance in the Scholaſtical Conſideration of it. Subſtance what, that it is Firſt or Second. Second Subſtance is called a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, a ſuppoſitum, or a ſubſiſtent. Of the Principle of Individuation, or that which makes a ſingular to be ſo. Dr.

The Trinity a Myſtery, and Doctrine of Faith; not a Point of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and ſo the Idea of it to be derived only from Revelation in the Holy Scriptures, and not from bare Diſcourſes of Reaſon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have Diſcourſed of <hi>Subſtance</hi> after the
<hi>Harmonical</hi> way, in the Precedent Chapters. It now remaineth that I add ſomething concerning it in the <hi>Scholaſtical;</hi> and thus, Subſtance is defined to be a thing that is by it ſelf, or that is under others called Accidents; and is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Firſt,</hi> and <hi>Second.</hi> The Second Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is that which is not in a Subject, but may be Praedicated of it, and ſuch are Generical and Specifical Subſtances; as
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65808:138"/>for example, Living Creature, and Man; neither of which is in a ſubject, as an Accident is, but both are Praedicated of it; for Living Creature is Praedicated of <hi>Man,</hi> and Man of <hi>Peter, James, John,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for firſt Subſtance (which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I deſign to ſpeak of more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) it is defined to be that which neither is in a Subject (as an Accident is,) nor is Praedicated of it, as the ſecond ſubſtance is; it is alſo called a <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> a ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or a ſingular, in which is wont to be diſtinguſhed
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subſiſtence; Subſiſtence</hi> is a mode of Exiſtence, to which it adds Perſeity, and <hi>Exiſtence</hi> is Eſſence in Act; the <hi>Nature</hi> is the Idea or Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Conception of a Subſtance. Or thus, the <hi>Nature</hi> is the Thing or Subſtance as it is defined; a <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> is the Thing or Subſtance that hath that Nature or Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nature and Subſiſtence differ but as Eſſence and Exiſtence; Subſiſtence being but the Exiſtence of a ſubſtantial Nature. But Nature and a Suppoſitum Differ, as
<hi>Eſſentia</hi> and <hi>Ens,</hi> the Former ſignifying (as the Schools ſpeak) <hi>ut Quâ,</hi> the latter <hi>ut Quod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a ſingular Subſtance or <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> that which comes particularly into Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is the <hi>Principle</hi> (as Schollars call it) of <hi>Individuation;</hi> or that which makes
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65808:139"/>a ſingular to become a ſingular, for the
<hi>Nature</hi> is ſuppoſed to belong to one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular no more than to another, but to be a thing abſtracted from all Particulars, and thence the queſtion ariſes, what that is that <hi>ſingularizes</hi> the Nature; (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that of Man,) and makes it to belong to <hi>Peter,</hi> or to
<hi>John,</hi> or to <hi>James</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. This Principle of Individuation, (be it what it will,) may (as is thought by ſome,) be called the individuating <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;</hi> as well as that which does divide the
<hi>Genius</hi> and conſtitute the Species, is called the ſpecifical, ſince this indiuidua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Principle doth as much divide the <hi>Species,</hi> and conſtitute the individual, as the ſpecifical difference divides the
<hi>Genius,</hi> and conſtitutes the ſpecies. Much ado there is what this Principle ſhould be; but after all, they ſeem to me to come neareſt to the Truth, who do affirm, that a ſingular or individual becomes ſo, not by any diſtinct Principle of individuation, but immediately and <hi>per ſe,</hi> and in that, that it is in being; juſt as <hi>Quantity</hi> is
<hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated</hi> by ſelf, and not by mediation of another Thing, that ſhould confine and bound it; and in like manner is <hi>Figured,</hi> not by any thing ſuperadded to it, but barely in that it is thus and thus Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>

                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:65808:139"/>I am already almoſt tired with this idle fruitleſs way of talking, and ſhould not overcome my ſelf to proceed any farther in it, but that the <hi>Notion</hi> a Learned Perſon has of late delivered to the World, about the <hi>Individuation of Spirits,</hi> will oblige me to Conſider <hi>it,</hi> and by affording matter of more intelligible Diſcourſe, make ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the dryneſs and barrenneſs of the former.

<hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> but is not Conſcious to the Thoughts and Paſſions of any other Spirit; and therefore if there were <hi>three</hi> Created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſo United as to be Conſcious each to others Thoughts, I cannot ſee any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we might not ſay that three ſuch Perſons were
<hi>not</hi> numerically one. <pb n="272" facs="tcp:65808:140"/>He adds, let any Man, who can give me any other notion of the numerical One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an <hi>Infinite Mind</hi> but ſelf-conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this Learned Perſon.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that the <hi>Numerical Oneneſs</hi> of Spirits can be nothing elſe but (as this Learned Author ſays it is) every Spirits <hi>Unity</hi> (he might as well have ſaid Oneneſs) with it ſelf, and its diſtinct and ſeparate ſubſiſtence from all other Created Spirits. But this is not the oneneſs of
<hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> only, but of <hi>every</hi> thing elſe that is one; for as
<hi>omne ens eſt unum,</hi> ſo <hi>unum eſt, quod eſt indiviſum in ſe, &amp; Diviſum a quoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Alio;</hi> and therefore it doth hold in
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> as well as in Spirits, and perhaps in the Infinite firſt Being, as well as in all Created Finite Beings. But to confine my ſelf, (as this Learned Author does) to the <hi>Numerical Oneneſs of Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> I cannot ſay farther of it, as he has, that it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>ſelf-Conſciouſneſs,</hi> in the ſenſe of the word as he unfolds it, I ſay as he <hi>Unfolds</hi> it; for elſe, taking ſelf-conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for a Spirits ſelf-being, ſo I take it the numerical oneneſs of a Spirit is nothing but its ſelf-conſciouſneſs, for then the meaning is, that a Spirit (which is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative Being) is <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and not any other thing; but taking Conſciouſneſs as he <pb n="273" facs="tcp:65808:140"/>does, for a Spirits Being
<hi>ſenſible</hi> of its own <hi>Actions</hi> and Paſſions, ſo its numerical one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be its ſelf-conſciouſneſs. For as a Being (and even a Cogitative Being as a Being) muſt be conceived to <hi>be,</hi> before it can be conceived to <hi>Act;</hi> ſo again, it muſt be conceived to act, that is to <hi>Think</hi> to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to <hi>Love,</hi> to
<hi>Hate,</hi> (for theſe are the Actions he inſtances in) for ſome moment of Reaſon <hi>before</hi> it can be conceived to be
<hi>Conſcious</hi> of theſe its actings. Now for that <hi>Moment</hi> of Reaſon, in which a Spirit is conceived <hi>in Being,</hi> without being concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be acting, and in which it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Acting</hi> before it becomes <hi>Conſcious</hi> of its actings, in that precedent moment, (which ſpeaks <hi>order,</hi> not <hi>duration,</hi>) it muſt be conceived to be <hi>one with it ſelf,</hi> and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically different from every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; and therefore that it is <hi>ſo,</hi> cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from ſelf-conſciouſneſs, or its being conſcious of its own actings. So that if there were (as in the Authors ſuppoſal) <hi>three</hi> created Spirits, that were as conſcious to each others Thoughts and Paſſions, as each of them unto his own, there would yet be no reaſon, that we ſhould ſay (as he ſays we muſt) that three ſuch perſons would be numerically one; for if they were, how could they be Three? ſince the number Three, is not the number One, and they <pb n="274" facs="tcp:65808:141"/>cannot be Three in number, if they are but one in number; to be Three is to be more than One; to be but One is not to be more than one. All that could be ſaid of them is, that upon that ſuppoſal they would be <hi>intimate</hi> with one another, but with nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical diſtinction; for ſtill one of them would not be the other, and ſo they would remain Three Perſons ſtill, not one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Self-Unity is before Self-Conſciouſneſs, and may conſiſt with Conſciouſneſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Again,</hi> in Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s way of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, which is, that Three Perſons ſo intimate to one another as he ſuppoſes, would become numerically one, I do not ſee but that inſtead of the <hi>Three</hi> Perſons of the Bleſſed
<hi>Trinity,</hi> (which doubtleſs he will own to be really as intimate to one another, as he ſuppoſes his Three Finite ones to be,) we ſhall have but <hi>one</hi> Perſon (in number.) <hi>In fine,</hi> if Perſons by being ſo intimate to one another do become numerically one, I do not ſee but that, by this reaſoning, God who is as conſcious to all the Actions, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Thoughts, of all Finite Created Spirits, as theſe are to their own, and as the Doctors Imaginary Perſons are to one anothers, he muſt be numerically one with them all. But perhaps the Doctor will tell me, that he affirms the Three Eternal Minds (for ſo he calls them) are numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally <pb n="275" facs="tcp:65808:141"/>one <hi>God,</hi> not one <hi>Perſon,</hi>
[Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, one God;] but then it will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, ſince Three are <hi>thrice one,</hi> what that is that makes each Perſon one in it ſelf, and diſtinguiſhes it from both the others? for it muſt be ſomething that is not <hi>Common,</hi> which ſelf-conſciouſneſs is, (in his ſenſe of the word,) all being as conſcious to one anothers Thoughts and Actings, as each unto its own: whereas, <hi>that</hi> which makes a thing numerically one, muſt be <hi>Differencing</hi> and Particular. Not to inſiſt, that to be an Eternal Mind is the true <hi>Idea</hi> or notion of God, and then if there be (as he owns there be) Three Eternal Minds (really diſtinct,) it will I confeſs, be no great difficulty to evince them Thee Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but I doubt it will, intelligibly to make it out, that theſe Three (Three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Minds, really diſtinct from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) are not Three <hi>Gods,</hi> as well as Three Perſons. So that methinks the knot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains untied. For my own part, I believe as the Scriptures inſtruct me, that there is but <hi>one God,</hi> tho' <hi>Three Perſons;</hi> each of which is <hi>God;</hi> which I ſay only to prevent Miſtakes. But I reſolve to Diſcourſe more fully of <hi>Unity</hi> or Oneneſs, when I come to treat of the notions of <hi>Whole</hi> and <hi>Part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the name [Perſon] it properly belongs to <hi>Men;</hi> we do not commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65808:142"/>it to <hi>Beaſts,</hi> or unto
<hi>Angels,</hi> or other Spirits, but by Tranſlation and Metaphor, when they do appear in the Figure or ſhape of Men. Nor is [Perſon] a name of
<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> taking nature in the ſenſe of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for Nature is <hi>Common</hi> unto all of the kind, but that only is <hi>Perſonal</hi> which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing and peculiar among thoſe in the ſame kind. Thus, <hi>Man</hi> is a name of the <hi>kind;</hi> or ſpecifical Nature, the Nature in common; <hi>A</hi> Man an expreſſion of the Nature as
<hi>ſingularized;</hi> but <hi>Perſon</hi> properly is the name of that which differences Men from one another. When we ſpeak of the Perſon of a Man, we mean by it that Cumble of Accidents, External, Internal, of Body, of Mind, Adventitious and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſical, Abſolute or Relative, whereby he is diſtinguiſhed, and known from others. Hence <hi>Perſona</hi> in Latin, is

In conformity to this Idea or notion of Perſon, I underſtand <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt not favour the</hi> Perſon <hi>of the Poor, nor honour the</hi> Perſon <hi>of the Mighty;</hi> the word for Perſon is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65808:142"/>This, thou ſhalt not in giving Judgment have regard to the Poverty of the one, or to the Riches of another; for theſe concern the
<hi>Perſon,</hi> not the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> In this ſenſe alſo is God ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> no <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter of Mens Perſons,</hi> for that he in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſpects not (as Men too often do) the foreign <hi>Qualities</hi> and Accidents that do diſtinguiſh them from one another, as, their wit, or their weakneſs; their comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or their deformity; their riches, or their Poverty; their Grandeur or their Littleneſs of Figure in the World. But all is as one to him, when he enters into Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for he judges uprightly, according to the <hi>merits of the Cauſe,</hi> without regard to the Perſon, ſave where the Conſideration of the Perſon is of moment (as ſometimes it is) in the merits of the Cauſe. But as <hi>the</hi> Perſon of a Man is that bundle of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that do diſtinguiſh him from others; ſo <hi>A</hi> Perſon is a Man with thoſe Qualities; that is, a Perſon is a <hi>Diſtinguiſhed</hi> Man; and ſo the word comes to be taken, not only for the <hi>Qualities</hi> that do diſtinguiſh, but for the <hi>Man</hi> that is diſtinguiſhed, by thoſe qualities; in which ſenſe the word is uſed, not only by the
<hi>Schoolmen,</hi> who after <hi>Boetius,</hi> define a Perſon to be a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſubſiſtent, <hi>Rationalis Naturae Individua ſubſtantia;</hi> but by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> when he
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65808:143"/>ſpeaks, 2 Cor. 1.11. <hi>of Thanks being given by many</hi> Perſons <hi>for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid (and I have ſaid the more for that the cauſe of late has had a freſh Rehearing) we may judge of the juſtice of
<hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius Valla,</hi> who in his Elegance, <hi>l.</hi> VI. <hi>c.</hi>
34. ſeverely, (or rather inſolently) reflects upon <hi>Boetius</hi> for aſſerting that a Perſon was not a Quality, or in any other Predicament but that of Subſtance; he ſhows in many inſtances, that [Perſon] ſignifies <hi>Quality,</hi> and thence infers, that the ſame man may ſuſtain a hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; [<hi>Quo ſit,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ut Aſſit mihi Multiplex Perſona ac Diverſa, ſed una tantum ſubſtantia;</hi>] and to give an Example, he fancies himſelf a
<hi>Hector,</hi> and ſays [<hi>ad Priamum ſum Perſonâ Filii, ad Aſtianacta perſonâ Patris, ad Andromacham perſonâ Viri; ad Paridem perſonâ Fratris; ad Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedonem perſonâ Amici; ad Achillem perſonâ Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mici.</hi>] In fine, making application of what he ſays unto the <hi>Deity,</hi> he thinks that he has carried the Prize, by demonſtrating <hi>how</hi> God may be but <hi>one Subſtance,</hi> and yet be <hi>Three Perſons;</hi> But 'tis in a way in which his <hi>Hector</hi> may be a <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> and God as <hi>many,</hi> and more. So that I had not believed it worth my while to mention this Opinion, but that an <hi>Excellent Perſon</hi> of our own has given it freſh reputation, by going the ſame way; for the Learned Author of the <hi>Three Sermons concerning the Sacred Triny,</hi> ſhews, as <hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> does, that the word
[Perſon] was uſed of old to ſignifie the <hi>State,</hi> Quality, or Condition of a Man, as he ſtands related to other Men, either as a
<hi>King,</hi> or a <hi>Subject,</hi> or as <hi>Father,</hi> or a <hi>Son,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he obſerves the Latin Phraſe is <hi>Perſonam Imponere</hi> when a Man is<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65808:143"/>put into Office or a Dignity Conferred upon him; <hi>Induere perſonam,</hi> when he takes upon him the Office;
<hi>Suſtinere perſonam,</hi> when one bears, or Executes an Office,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſhort, he tells us, (as <hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> has) that 'tis nothing ſtrange for the <hi>ſame</hi> man to ſuſtain
<hi>Divers</hi> Perſons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing in <hi>Tully,</hi> who ſays;
<hi>ſuſtineo unus Tres Perſonas, Meam, Adverſarii, Judicis,</hi> I being but one, do yet ſuſtain Three Perſons, my own, that of an Adverſary, and that of a Judge. <hi>In fine,</hi> he makes the ſame application of it to the Divine Trin-unity that <hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> doth, for (ſays he) if Three Perſons may be one man, what hinders but that Three Divers Perſons may be one God? and that the <hi>ſame God</hi> as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the World, or God the Creator may be God the <hi>Father;</hi> and as Author of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be God the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> or God the <hi>Son;</hi> and as working effectually in the hearts of his Elect, be God the Sanctifier or God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs if this is <hi>all</hi> that is in the Myſtery, it is very Conceiveable, and (which will be an unvaluable happineſs to the Chriſtian World) there will need to be no more diſpute about it: but as the
<hi>Received Doctrine</hi> of the Divine Trin-unity is quite another thing, ſo muſt it have a very different <hi>Expoſition.</hi> Beſides,
<hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> ſeems to ſuppoſe that the difficulty is only about the <hi>word</hi> [Perſon,] But this is his miſtake; for the word
[Perſon] as applied to the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is but of a <hi>later</hi> uſe, and of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whoſe word is
<hi>Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> which is alſo the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> word: So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it can be found, that one Man can be three <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> or Subſiſtents, and that for God to be a Creator, a Redeemer, and a Sanctifier, is,<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65808:144"/>to be three <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> in the
<hi>Fathers</hi> ſenſe, as well as Three <hi>Perſons</hi> in
<hi>Cicero's,</hi> the <hi>Difficulty</hi> is not removed, but only avoided.
<hi>In fine,</hi> it is not the ſame thing to ſay that one
<hi>ſuſtains</hi> Three Perſons, as to ſay that one <hi>is</hi> Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: For he that only ſuſtains a Perſon, doth but <hi>Act</hi> the part of that Perſon which he is ſaid to ſuſtain; and thus
<hi>Cicero</hi> ſuſtained Three Perſons, when he acted as if he had been Three ſeveral Men under different Characters: To <hi>Perſonate</hi> a Judge is not <hi>to be</hi> one: And in this ſenſe of the word Perſon
<hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Ep.</hi> 24. <hi>non hominibus tantum, ſed &amp; Rebus PERSONA Demenda eſt, &amp; reddenda facies ſua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay not this with any intention to enter into a Diſcourſe of the Divine Trin-unity, the doing of which would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, in a Treatiſe that pretends but to Metaphyſicks: I have only mention'd it on occaſion, as an inquiry after the Idea and notion of a
<hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> and that of a <hi>Perſon,</hi> obliged me. The
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is a point of pure
<hi>Revelation,</hi> not of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> or Science; all Diſcouaſes and explications of it, not derived from the Holy Scriptures, and grounded upon them, but on Analogies and Reſemblances in <hi>nature,</hi> or on Principles of Human <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> and meer Reaſon, are as Foreign unto it, as Earth is to Heaven. It is an Article of Faith, and a Fundamental one too; indeed the chief of all thoſe of which the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays, they are ſuch as <hi>neither Eye ſaw, nor Ear heard of, nor entred into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> before they were brought to light in the Goſpel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 'tis there only that we are obliged to ſeek it, and there only, in the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, that we can hope to diſcover it, in its true Idea and Notion. And ſo much for Subſtance as Scholaſtically Conſider'd.</p>
